abstract = {Abstract Stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) is important for the chemical composition of both the stratosphere and troposphere. Modifications of STE in a changing climate may affect stratospheric ozone depletion and the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere significantly. However, STE is still poorly understood and inadequately quantified, due to the involvement of physical and dynamical processes on local to global scales and to conceptual problems. In this study, a present-day global climatology of STE is developed that is based, from a data standpoint, on 15 yr of global meteorological reanalyses, and, from a conceptual standpoint, on a Lagrangian perspective that considers the pathways of exchange air parcels and their residence times in the troposphere and lowermost stratosphere. To this end, two complementary Lagrangian models are used. Particular consideration is given to “deep” exchange events that, through fast ascent of tropospheric or fast descent of stratospheric air masses, bring into co...},

abstract = {We present the new version (v14) of the BIRA-IASB algorithm for the retrieval of formaldehyde (H2CO) columns from spaceborne UV-Visible sensors.  Applied to OMI measurements from Aura and to GOME-2 measurements from MetOp-A and B, this algorithm is used to produce global distributions of H2CO representative of mid-morning and early afternoon conditions. Its main features include (1) a new iterative DOAS scheme involving three fitting intervals to better account for the O2-O2 absorption, (2) the use of earthshine radiances averaged in the equatorial Pacific as reference spectra, (3) a destriping correction and background normalisation resolved in the along-swath position. For the air mass factor calculation, a priori vertical profiles calculated by the IMAGES chemistry transport model at 9.30 a.m. and 13.30 p.m. are used.  Although the resulting GOME-2 and OMI H2CO vertical columns are found to be highly correlated, some systematic differences are observed. Afternoon columns are generally larger than morning ones, especially in mid-latitude regions. In contrast, over tropical rainforests, morning H2CO columns significantly exceed those observed in the afternoon. These differences are discussed in terms of the H2CO column variation between mid-morning and early afternoon, using ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements available from seven stations in Europe, China and Africa. Validation results confirm the capacity of the combined satellite measurements to resolve diurnal variations in H2CO columns.  Furthermore, vertical profiles derived from MAX-DOAS measurements in the Beijing area and in Bujumbura are used for a more detailed validation exercise. In both regions, we find an agreement better than 15% when MAX-DOAS profiles are used as a priori for the satellite retrievals. Finally regional trends in H2CO columns are estimated for the 2004–2014 period using SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 data for morning conditions, and OMI for early afternoon conditions. Consistent features are observed such as an increase of the columns in India and Central-East China, and a decrease in Eastern US and Europe. We find that the higher horizontal resolution of OMI combined to a better sampling and a more favourable illumination at mid-day allow for more significant trend estimates, especially over Europe and North America. Importantly, in some parts of the Amazonian forest, we observe with both time series a significant downward trend in H2CO columns, spatially correlated with areas affected by deforestation.},

abstract = {Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) and biomass burning (BB) are two important natural sources for tropospheric ozone, that can result in elevated ozone and air-quality episode events. High-resolution observations of multiple related species are critical for complex ozone source attribution. In this article, we present an analysis of coinciding ground-based and airborne observations, including ozone lidar, ozonesonde, high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL), and multiple airborne in situ measurements, made on 28 and 29 June 2013 during the Southeast Nexus (SENEX) field campaign. The ozone lidar and HSRL reveal detailed ozone and aerosol structures as well as the temporal evolution associated with a cold front passage. The observations also captured two enhanced (+30 ppbv) ozone layers in the free troposphere (FT), which were determined from this study to be caused by a mixture of BB and stratospheric sources. The mechanism for this STT is tropopause folding associated with a cutoff upper-level low pressure system according to the analysis of its potential vorticity structure. The depth of the tropopause fold appears to be shallow for this case compared to events observed in other seasons, however, the impact on lower tropospheric ozone was clearly observed. This event suggests that strong STT may occur in the southeast United States during the summer and can potentially impact lower troposphere during these times. Statistical analysis of the airborne observations of trace gases suggests a coincident influence of BB transport in the FT impacting the vertical structure of ozone during this case study. },

abstract = {The standard Dobson Umkehr methodology to re-trieve coarse-resolution ozone profiles used by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration uses desig-nated solar zenith angles (SZAs). However, some informa-tion may be lost if measurements lie outside the designated SZA range (between 60 • and 90 •), or do not conform to the fitting technique. Also, while Umkehr measurements can be taken using multiple wavelength pairs (A, C and D), past retrieval methods have focused on a single pair (C). Here we present an Umkehr inversion method that uses measure-ments at all SZAs (termed operational) and all wavelength pairs. (Although, we caution direct comparison to other al-gorithms.) Information content for a Melbourne, Australia (38 • S, 145 • E) Umkehr measurement case study from 28 Jan-uary 1994, with SZA range similar to that designated in previous algorithms is shown. When comparing the typical single wavelength pair with designated SZAs to the opera-tional measurements, the total degrees of freedom (indepen-dent pieces of information) increases from 3.1 to 3.4, with the majority of the information gain originating from Umkehr layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10–20 km and 25–30 km respectively). In addition to this, using all available wavelength pairs in-creases the total degrees of freedom to 5.2, with the most significant increases in Umkehr layers 2 + 3 to 7 and 9+ (10– 40 and 45–80 km). Investigating a case from 13 April 1970 where the measurements extend beyond the 90 • SZA range gives further information gain, with total degrees of freedom extending to 6.5. Similar increases are seen in the informa-tion content. Comparing the retrieved Melbourne Umkehr time series with ozonesondes shows excellent agreement in layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10–20 and 25–30 km) for both C and A + C + D-pairs. Retrievals in layers 5 and 6 (25–30 and 30– 35 km) consistently show lower ozone partial column com-pared to ozonesondes. This is likely due to stray light effects that are not accounted for in the forward model, and under represented stratospheric aerosol.},

We use EPPA-HE to assess the human health damages (including mortality and morbidity) caused by ozone pollution, and quantify their economic impacts in sixteen world regions. We compare the costs of ozone pollution under scenarios with 2000 and 2050 ozone precursor and greenhouse gas emissions (using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario). We estimate that health costs due to global ozone pollution above pre-industrial levels by 2050 will be $580 billion (year 2000$) and that mortalities from acute exposure will exceed 2 million. We ﬁnd that previous methodologies underestimate costs of air pollution by more than a third because they do not take into account the long-term, compounding effects of health costs. The economic effects of emissions changes far exceed the inﬂuence of climate alone.},

A special effort has been made to ensure the coherence and quality of the CH2O dataset covering the period 1996–2007. Optimised DOAS settings are proposed in order to reduce the impact of two important sources of error in the derivation of slant columns, namely, the polarisation anomaly affecting the SCIAMACHY spectra around 350 nm, and a major absorption band of the O4 collision complex centred near 360 nm. The air mass factors are determined from scattering weights generated using radiative transfer calculations taking into account the cloud fraction, the cloud height and the ground albedo. Vertical profile shapes of CH2O are provided by the global CTM IMAGES based on an up-to-date representation of emissions, atmospheric transport and photochemistry. A comprehensive error analysis is presented. This includes errors on the slant columns retrieval and errors on the air mass factors which are mainly due to uncertainties in the a priori profile and in the cloud properties. The major features of the retrieved formaldehyde column distribution are discussed and compared with previous CH2O datasets over the major emission regions.},

A significant number of these OH measurements were made by laser-induced fluorescence in low-pressure detection chambers (called Fluorescence Assay with Gas Expansion (FAGE)) using the Penn State Ground-based Tropospheric Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS). We deployed a new chemical removal method to measure OH in parallel with the traditional FAGE method in a California forest. The new method gives on average only 40-60% of the OH from the traditional method and this discrepancy is temperature dependent. Evidence indicates that the new method measures atmospheric OH while the traditional method is affected by internally generated OH, possibly from oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds. The improved agreement between OH measured by this new technique and modeled OH suggests that oxidation chemistry in at least one forest atmosphere is better understood than previously thought.},

The measurements were carried out at Bresso, an urban site in the periphery of Milan ( Italy) as part of the FORMAT-I field campaign. Eight instruments were employed by six independent research groups using four different techniques: Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS), Fourier Transform Infra Red ( FTIR) interferometry, the fluorimetric Hantzsch reaction technique ( five instruments) and a chromatographic technique employing C18-DNPH-cartridges (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine). White type multi-reflection systems were employed for the optical techniques in order to avoid spatial CH2O gradients and ensure the sampling of nearly the same air mass by all instruments. Between 23 and 31 July 2002, up to 13 ppbv of CH2O were observed. The concentrations lay well above the detection limits of all instruments. The formaldehyde concentrations determined with DOAS, FTIR and the Hantzsch instruments were found to agree within +/- 11%, with the exception of one Hantzsch instrument, which gave systematically higher values. The two hour integrated samples by DNPH yielded up to 25% lower concentrations than the data of the continuously measuring instruments averaged over the same time period. The consistency between the DOAS and the Hantzsch method was better than during previous intercomparisons in ambient air with slopes of the regression line not significantly differing from one. The differences between the individual Hantzsch instruments could be attributed in part to the calibration standards used. Possible systematic errors of the methods are discussed.},

In particular, the focus is on isoprene, monoterpenes, and oxygen- ated hydrocarbons. The generated science during the last 10 years is reviewed to explain and quantify hydrocarbon emissions from vegetation and to discern impacts of biogenic hydrocarbons on local and regional atmospheric chemis- try. Furthermore, the physiological and environmental processes controlling biosynthesis and production of hydrocar- bon compounds are reported on. Many advances have been made on measurement and modeling approaches developed to quantify hydrocarbon emissions from leaves and forest ecosystems. A synthesis of the atmospheric chemistry of bio- genic hydrocarbons and their role in the formation of oxidants and aerosols is presented. The integration of biogenic hydrocarbon kinetics and atmospheric physics into mathematical modeling systems is examined to assess the contribu- tion of biogenic hydrocarbons to the formation of oxidants and aerosols, thereby allowing us to study their impacts on the earth's climate system and to develop strategies to reduce oxidant precursors in affected regions. aDepartment},

abstract = {Air mass factor (AMF) calculation is the largest source of uncertainty in NO2 and HCHO satellite retrievals in situations with enhanced trace gas concentrations in the lower troposphere. Structural uncertainty arises when different retrieval methodologies are applied in the scientific community to the same satellite observations. Here, we address the issue of AMF structural uncertainty via a detailed comparison of AMF calculation methods that are structurally different between seven retrieval groups for measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We estimate the escalation of structural uncertainty in every sub-step of the AMF calculation process. This goes beyond the algorithm uncertainty estimates provided in state-of-the-art retrievals, which address the theoretical propagation of uncertainties for one particular retrieval algorithm only. We find that top-of-atmosphere reflectances simulated by four radiative transfer models (RTMs) (DAK, McArtim, SCIATRAN and VLIDORT) agree within 1.5&thinsp;%. We find that different retrieval groups agree well in the calculations of altitude resolved AMFs from different RTMs (to within 3&thinsp;%), and in the tropospheric AMFs (to within 6&thinsp;%) as long as identical ancillary data (surface albedo, terrain height, cloud parameters and trace gas profile) and cloud and aerosol correction procedures are being used. Structural uncertainty increases sharply when retrieval groups use their preference for ancillary data, cloud and aerosol correction. On average, we estimate the AMF structural uncertainty to be 42&thinsp;% over polluted regions and 31&thinsp;% over unpolluted regions, mostly driven by substantial differences in the a priori trace gas profiles, surface albedo and cloud parameters.

abstract = {Developing predictive capability for future atmo-spheric oxidation capacity requires a detailed analysis of model uncertainties and sensitivity of the modeled oxidation capacity to model input variables. Using oxidant mixing ra-tios modeled by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and measured on the NASA DC-8 aircraft, uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses were performed on the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model for the modeled oxidants hy-droxyl (OH), hydroperoxyl (HO 2), and ozone (O 3). The sen-sitivity of modeled OH, HO 2 , and ozone to model inputs per-turbed simultaneously within their respective uncertainties were found for the flight tracks of NASA's Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) A and B campaigns (2008) in the North American Arctic. For the spring deployment (ARCTAS-A), ozone was most sensitive to the photolysis rate of NO 2 , the NO 2 + OH reaction rate, and various emissions, including methyl bromoform (CHBr 3). OH and HO 2 were overwhelm-ingly sensitive to aerosol particle uptake of HO 2 with this one factor contributing upwards of 75 % of the uncertainty in HO 2 . For the summer deployment (ARCTAS-B), ozone was most sensitive to emission factors, such as soil NO x and isoprene. OH and HO 2 were most sensitive to biomass emis-sions and aerosol particle uptake of HO 2 . With modeled HO 2 showing a factor of 2 underestimation compared to measure-ments in the lowest 2 km of the troposphere, lower uptake rates ($\gamma$ HO 2 < 0.055), regardless of whether or not the prod-uct of the uptake is H 2 O or H 2 O 2 , produced better agreement between modeled and measured HO 2 .},

abstract = {The SCIAMACHY satellite instrument shows enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) columns in the Southern Hemisphere during the local Spring. Chemistry-transport model simulations using the new GFEDv2 biomass-burning emission database show a similar temporal and spatial CO distribution, indicating that the observed enhancements are mainly due to biomass burning (BB). Large differences between the year 2003 and 2004 are observed in both the measurements and the model for South America and Australia. This study analyzes the origin of these observed enhancements in the Southern Hemisphere. The fact that SCIAMACHY is sensitive to surface CO allows for the observation of enhanced CO columns in both emission areas and in areas that are affected by long-range transport of CO. Model results show a large contribution of South American BB CO over Australian BB regions during the 2004 BB season of up to ∼30–35% and up to 55% further south, with smaller contributions for 2003. BB CO transported from southern Africa contributes up to ∼40% in 2003 and ∼30% in 2004. The results indicate that differences between SCIAMACHY CO and the model simulations over Australian BB areas are probably not only caused by uncertainties in local emissions but also in overseas emissions.},

abstract = {The geographic and temporal variations in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone columns from individual swath measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), on the NASA Aura spacecraft, are reasonably well simulated by the University of California, Irvine (UCI) chemistry transport model (CTM) using 1 degrees x 1 degrees x 40-layer meteorological fields for the year 2005. From the CTM we find that high-frequency spatial variations in tropospheric column ozone (TCO), including around the jet streams, are not generally correlated with variations in stratospheric ozone column, but instead are collocated with folding events involving stratospheric-origin, high-ozone layers below the tropopause. The CTM fold events are verified in many cases with available ozone sondes. Using the OMI Level 2 profiles, and defining tropopause height from our CTM using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fields, we find that most of the variations in TCO near CTM folding events are also not correlated with those in stratospheric ozone column. A large fraction of the OMI TCO variance is accurately simulated by the CTM where the variance is significant, especially along the subtropical jets. The absolute tropospheric columns from OMI and CTM agree swath-by-swath, pixel-by-pixel within +/- 5 Dobson Units (DU) for most cases. Notable exceptions are in the tropics where neither the high ozone from biomass burning nor the low ozone in the convergence zones over the Pacific is found in the OMI observations, because of OMI's insensitivity to the lower troposphere. Another difference is identified with the OMI profiles near the southern subtropical jet. The CTM has a high bias in stratospheric column outside the tropics, due to problems previously identified with the stratospheric circulation in the 40-layer meteorological fields. Overall, we identify ozone folds with short-lived features in TCO that have scales of a few hundred kilometres as observed by OMI.},

abstract = {[1] Altitude profiles of ozone (O 3) over Lauder (45°S, 170°E) performed using a lidar, ozonesondes, and the satellite-borne Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE II) instrument are presented. These data form one of the few long-term sets of O 3 profiles at a Southern Hemisphere location. In the 5 years of data presented, the dominant variation is the annual cycle, the phase and amplitude of which differ below and above 27.5 km. Superposed are irregular episodic variations, caused by various processes. The first process studied is stratosphere-troposphere exchange, characterized by dry and O 3 -rich air residing in the troposphere, which was found in 21% of the measurements. The second relates to the positioning of the higher polar vortex over Lauder, often in combination with the exchange of air between midlatitude and subtropical stratospheric regions. We present examples of this which were observed over Lauder during the 1997 winter. This winter was selected for further study because of the record-low O 3 amounts measured. The third process is mixing of O 3 -depleted vortex air with midlatitude air after the vortex breakup. We present one example, which shows that a filament originating from the depleted Antarctic vortex significantly lowers O 3 amounts over Lauder around 27 November 1997. There is thus a connection between Antarctic O 3 depletion and later decrease of O 3 amounts at a Southern Hemisphere midlatitude location, namely Lauder.},

abstract = {We have analysed time-slice simulations from 17 global models, participating in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP), to explore changes in present-day (2000) hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration and methane (CH4) lifetime relative to preindustrial times (1850) and to 1980. A comparison of modeled and observation-derived methane and methyl chloroform lifetimes suggests that the present-day global multi-model mean OH concentration is overestimated by 5 to 10% but is within the range of uncertainties. The models consistently simulate higher OH concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) compared with the Southern Hemisphere (SH) for the present-day (2000; inter-hemispheric ratios of 1.13 to 1.42), in contrast to observation-based approaches which generally indicate higher OH in the SH although uncertainties are large. Evaluation of simulated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations, the primary sink for OH, against ground-based and satellite observations suggests low biases in the NH that may contribute to the high north-south OH asymmetry in the models. The models vary widely in their regional distribution of present-day OH concentrations (up to 34 %). Despite large regional changes, the multi-model global mean (mass-weighted) OH concentration changes little over the past 150 yr, due to concurrent increases in factors that enhance OH (humidity, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and UV radiation due to decreases in stratospheric ozone), compensated by increases in OH sinks (methane abundance, carbon monoxide and non-methane volatile organic carbon (NMVOC) emissions). The large inter-model diversity in the sign and magnitude of preindustrial to present-day OH changes (ranging from a decrease of 12.7% to an increase of 14.6 %) indicate that uncertainty remains in our understanding of the long-term trends in OH and methane lifetime. We show that this diversity is largely explained by the different ratio of the change in global mean tropospheric CO and NOx burdens (Delta CO/Delta NOx, approximately represents changes in OH sinks versus changes in OH sources) in the models, pointing to a need for better constraints on natural precursor emissions and on the chemical mechanisms in the current generation of chemistry-climate models. For the 1980 to 2000 period, we find that climate warming and a slight increase in mean OH (3.5 +/- 2.2 %) leads to a 4.3 +/- 1.9% decrease in the methane lifetime. Analysing sensitivity simulations performed by 10 models, we find that preindustrial to present-day climate change decreased the methane lifetime by about four months, representing a negative feedback on the climate system. Further, we analysed attribution experiments performed by a subset of models relative to 2000 conditions with only one precursor at a time set to 1860 levels. We find that global mean OH increased by 46.4 +/- 12.2% in response to preindustrial to present-day anthropogenic NOx emission increases, and decreased by 17.3 +/- 2.3 %, 7.6 +/- 1.5 %, and 3.1 +/- 3.0% due to methane burden, and anthropogenic CO, and NMVOC emissions increases, respectively.},

The version of the algorithm described here includes relevant changes with respect to the operational one, including differences in the reference spectra for H2CO, the fit of O2–O2 collisional complex, updates in the high-resolution solar reference spectrum, the use of a model reference sector over the remote Pacific Ocean to normalize the retrievals, an updated air mass factor (AMF) calculation scheme, and the inclusion of scattering weights and vertical H2CO profile in the level 2 products. The setup of the retrieval is discussed in detail. We compare the results of the updated retrieval with the results from the previous SAO H2CO retrieval. The improvement in the slant column fit increases the temporal stability of the retrieval and slightly reduces the noise. The change in the AMF calculation has increased the AMFs by 20%, mainly due to the consideration of the radiative cloud fraction. Typical values for retrieved vertical columns are between 4 × 1015 and 4 × 1016 molecules cm−2, with typical fitting uncertainties ranging between 45 and 100%. In high-concentration regions the errors are usually reduced to 30%. The detection limit is estimated at 1 × 1016 molecules cm−2.},

abstract = {Numerical assessments of global air quality and potential changes in atmospheric chemical constituents require estimates of the surface fluxes of a variety of trace gas species. We have developed a global model to estimate emissions of volatile organic compounds from natural sources (NVOC). Methane is not considered here and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. The model has a highly resolved spatial grid (0.5° × 0.5° latitude/longitude) and generates hourly average emission estimates. Chemical species are grouped into four categories: isoprene, monoterpenes, other reactive VOC (ORVOC), and other VOC (OVOC). NVOC emissions from oceans are estimated as a function of geophysical variables from a general circulation model and ocean color satellite data. Emissions from plant foliage are estimated from ecosystem specific biomass and emission factors and algorithms describing light and temperature dependence of NVOC emissions. Foliar density estimates are based on climatic variables and satellite data. Temporal variations in the model are driven by monthly estimates of biomass and temperature and hourly light estimates. The annual global VOC flux is estimated to be 1150 Tg C, composed of 44% isoprene, 11% monoterpenes, 22.5% other reactive VOC, and 22.5% other VOC. Large uncertainties exist for each of these estimates and particularly for compounds other than isoprene and monoterpenes. Tropical woodlands (rain forest, seasonal, drought-deciduous, and savanna) contribute about half of all global natural VOC emissions. Croplands, shrublands and other woodlands contribute 10–20% apiece. Isoprene emissions calculated for temperate regions are as much as a factor of 5 higher than previous estimates.},

Important param-eters such as the leaf area index are fully determined by the global vegetation model and the influences of light extinc-tion (for isoprene emissions) and leaf age (for isoprene and methanol emissions) are also taken into account. We study the interannual variability of biogenic emissions using the satellite-based climate forcing ISLSCP-II as well as relevant CO 2 atmospheric levels, for the 1983–1995 period. Mean global emissions of 460 TgC/yr for isoprene, 117 TgC/yr for monoterpenes, 106 TgC/yr for methanol and 42 TgC/yr for acetone are predicted. The mean global emission of all bio-genic compounds is 752±16 TgC/yr with extremes ranging from 717 TgC/yr in 1986 to 778 TgC/yr in 1995, that is a 8.5% increase between both. This variability differs signif-icantly from one region to another and among the regions studied, biogenic emissions anomalies were the most vari-able in Europe and the least variable in Indonesia (isoprene and monoterpenes) and North America (methanol). Two sce-narios of land use changes are considered using the 1983 cli-mate and atmospheric CO 2 conditions, to study the sensi-tivity of biogenic emissions to vegetation alteration, namely tropical deforestation and European afforestation. Global biogenic emissions are highly affected by tropical deforesta-tion, with a 29% decrease in isoprene emission and a 22% increase in methanol emission. Global emissions are not sig-nificantly affected by European afforestation, but on a Euro-pean scale, total biogenic VOCs emissions increase by 54%.},

abstract = {The polar and subpolar tropopause in both hemispheres is investigated using the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA) data from 1979 to 1993 and radiosonde data from 1989 to 1993. Both the thermal and the dynamical criteria are applied to each dataset. The tropopauses derived from the radiosonde data are used to validate the ERA-derived tropopauses and to investigate the sharpness of the tropopause. The validation reveals that the ERA data are well suited for the determination of the tropopause. A comparison between the thermal and the dynamical tropopause shows a very good agreement except for polar winter, and there is clear evidence that the dynamical criterion is more appropriate in winter. The results show that the annual cycle of the polar tropopause can be classified into three different patterns. A single wave with a tropopause pressure maximum in winter and a minimum in summer is typical for the subpolar parts of eastern Siberia and North America. A double wave with pressure maxima in spring and autumn and minima in summer and winter is found above northern Europe, western Siberia, and generally at high Arctic latitudes. Finally, Antarctica exhibits a reversed single wave with a pressure maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Tropopause temperatures are generally highest in summer and lowest in winter, but the amplitude of their annual cycles shows distinct differences. It is lowest in those regions where a single pressure maximum in winter is present and largest in the Antarctic. A comparison between the tropopause pressure and the temperatures in 500 and 100 hPa reveals that the tropopause pressure is closely related to the temperature difference between 500 and 100 hPa. A large temperature difference corresponds to a low tropopause pressure and a small temperature difference to a high tropopause pressure. The sharpness of the tropopause, that is, the change in vertical temperature gradient across the tropopause, is found to be highest in summer and lowest in winter. Its annual cycle and its regional differences are primarily determined by the mean temperature gradient above the tropopause because it varies much more strongly than the gradient below the tropopause.},

The CO and HCHO are respectively from the MOPITT and OMI instruments. The multi-species and multi-satellite dataset inversion is done for the 2005–2010 period. The robustness of our results is evaluated by comparing our posterior-modeled concentrations with several sets of independent measurements of atmospheric mixing ratios. The inversion leads to significant changes from the prior to the posterior, in terms of magnitude and seasonality of the CO and CH4 surface fluxes and of the HCHO production by non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The latter is significantly decreased, indicating an overestimation of the biogenic NMVOC emissions, such as isoprene, in the GEIA inventory. CO and CH4 surface emissions are increased by the inversion, from 1037 to 1394 TgCO and from 489 to 529 TgCH4 on average for the 2005–2010 period. CH4 emissions present significant interannual variability and a joint CO-CH4 fluxes analysis reveals that tropical biomass burning probably played a role in the recent increase of atmospheric methane.},

abstract = {We examine the relative contribution of processes controlling the interannual variability (IAV) of tropospheric ozone over four sub-regions of the southern hemispheric tro-pospheric ozone maximum (SHTOM) over a 20-year period. Our study is based on hindcast simulations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Modeling Ini-tiative chemistry transport model (NASA GMI-CTM) of tro-pospheric and stratospheric chemistry, driven by assimilated Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Appli-cations (MERRA) meteorological fields. Our analysis shows that over SHTOM region, the IAV of the stratospheric con-tribution is the most important factor driving the IAV of up-per tropospheric ozone (270 hPa), where ozone has a strong radiative effect. Over the South Atlantic region, the contri-bution from surface emissions to the IAV of ozone exceeds that from stratospheric input at and below 430 hPa. Over the South Indian Ocean, the IAV of stratospheric ozone makes the largest contribution to the IAV of ozone with little or no influence from surface emissions at 270 and 430 hPa in aus-tral winter. Over the tropical South Atlantic region, the con-tribution from IAV of stratospheric input dominates in austral winter at 270 hPa and drops to less than half but is still signif-icant at 430 hPa. Emission contributions are not significant at these two levels. The IAV of lightning over this region also contributes to the IAV of ozone in September and December. Over the tropical southeastern Pacific, the contribution of the IAV of stratospheric input is significant at 270 and 430 hPa in austral winter, and emissions have little influence.},

abstract = {The chemical link between isoprene and formalde-hyde (HCHO) is a strong, nonlinear function of NO x (i.e., NO + NO 2). This relationship is a linchpin for top-down isoprene emission inventory verification from orbital HCHO column observations. It is also a benchmark for overall pho-tochemical mechanism performance with regard to VOC oxi-dation. Using a comprehensive suite of airborne in situ obser-vations over the southeast US, we quantify HCHO produc-tion across the urban–rural spectrum. Analysis of isoprene and its major first-generation oxidation products allows us to define both a " prompt " yield of HCHO (molecules of HCHO produced per molecule of freshly emitted isoprene) and the background HCHO mixing ratio (from oxidation of longer-lived hydrocarbons). Over the range of observed NO x val-ues (roughly 0.1–2 ppbv), the prompt yield increases by a factor of 3 (from 0.3 to 0.9 ppbv ppbv −1), while background HCHO increases by a factor of 2 (from 1.6 to 3.3 ppbv). We apply the same method to evaluate the performance of both a global chemical transport model (AM3) and a measurement-constrained 0-D steady-state box model. Both models repro-duce the NO x dependence of the prompt HCHO yield, illus-trating that models with updated isoprene oxidation mecha-nisms can adequately capture the link between HCHO and recent isoprene emissions. On the other hand, both mod-els underestimate background HCHO mixing ratios, suggest-ing missing HCHO precursors, inadequate representation of later-generation isoprene degradation and/or underestimated hydroxyl radical concentrations. Detailed process rates from the box model simulation demonstrate a 3-fold increase in HCHO production across the range of observed NO x val-ues, driven by a 100 % increase in OH and a 40 % increase in branching of organic peroxy radical reactions to produce HCHO.

abstract = {The rate of constitutive isoprenoid emissions from plants is driven by plant emission capacity under specified environmental conditions (Es, the emission factor) and by responsiveness of the emissions to instantaneous variations in environment. In models of isoprenoid emission, Es has been often considered as intrinsic species-specific constant invariable in time and space. Here we analyze the variations in species-specific values of E s under field conditions focusing on abiotic stresses, past environmental conditions and developmental processes. The reviewed studies highlight strong stress-driven, adaptive (previous temperature and light environment and growth CO2 concentration) and developmental (leaf age) variations in Es values operating at medium to long time scales. These biological factors can alter species-specific Es values by more than an order of magnitude. While the majority of models based on early concepts still ignore these important sources of variation, recent models are including some of the medium- to long-term controls. However, conceptually different strategies are being used for incorporation of these longer-term controls with important practical implications for parameterization and application of these models. This analysis emphasizes the need to include more biological realism in the isoprenoid emission models and also highlights the gaps in knowledge that require further experimental work to reduce the model uncertainties associated with biological sources of variation. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2010.},

@article{Jockel2005,
abstract = {The development of a comprehensive Earth System Model (ESM) to study the interactions between chemical, physical, and biological processes, requires coupling of the different domains (land, ocean, atmosphere,...). One strategy is to link existing domain-specific models with a universal coupler, i.e. an independent standalone program organizing the communication between other programs. In many cases, however, a much simpler approach is more feasible. We have developed the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). It comprises (1) a modular interface structure to connect submodels to a base model, (2) an extendable set of such submodels for miscellaneous processes, and (3) a coding standard. MESSy is therefore not a coupler in the classical sense, but exchanges data between a base model and several submodels within one comprehensive executable. The internal complexity of the submodels is controllable in a transparent and user friendly way. This provides remarkable new possibilities to study feedback mechanisms (by two-way coupling). Note that the MESSy and the coupler approach can be combined. For instance, an atmospheric model implemented according to the MESSy standard could easily be coupled to an ocean model by means of an external coupler. The vision is to ultimately form a comprehensive ESM which includes a large set of submodels, and a base model which contains only a central clock and runtime control. This can be reached stepwise, since each process can be included independently. Starting from an existing model, process submodels can be reimplemented according to the MESSy standard. This procedure guarantees the availability of a state-of-the-art model for scientific applications at any time of the development. In principle, MESSy can be implemented into any kind of model, either global or regional. So far, the MESSy concept has been applied to the general circulation model ECHAM5 and a number of process box-models.},

abstract = {Layers with strongly enhanced ozone concentrations in the middle-upper troposphere, referred to as Secondary Ozone Peaks (SOPs), have been observed in different regions of the world. Here we use the global ECHAM5/MESSy atmospheric chemistry model (EMAC) to (i) investigate the processes causing SOPs, (ii) explore both their frequency of occurrence and seasonality, and (iii) assess their effects on the tropospheric ozone budget over the Himalayas. The vertical profiles of potential vorticity (PV) and a stratospheric ozone tracer (O3s) in EMAC simulations, in conjunction with the structure of SOPs, suggest that SOPs over the Himalayas are formed by Stratosphere-to-Troposphere Transport (STT) of ozone. The spatial distribution of O3s further shows that such effects are in general confined to the northern part of India. Model simulated ozone distributions and backward air trajectories show that ozone rich air masses, associated with STT, originate as far as northern Africa and the North Atlantic Ocean, the Middle-East, as well as nearby regions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and are rapidly (within 2-3 days) transported to the Himalayas. Analysis of a 15-year (2000-2014) EMAC simulation shows that the frequency of SOPs is highest during the pre-monsoon season (e.g. 11% of the time in May), while no intense SOP events are found during the July-October period. The SOPs are estimated to enhance the Tropospheric Column Ozone (TCO) over the central Himalayas by up to 26%.},

The radar tropopause, defined as the maximum vertical gradient of echo return power, can be used as a definition of the Antarctic tropopause throughout the year under all meteorological conditions. During the extended summer period of December-April (DJFMA) inclusive, radar tropopauses are (0.2 +- 0.4) km lower than radiosonde lapse-rate (i.e. the World Meteorological Organisation - WMO) tropopauses and during the extended winter period of June-October (JJASO) inclusive, the radar tropopauses are (0.8 +- 1.0) km lower. A potential vorticity tropopause is defined as the altitude of the -2 PVU surface (where 1 PVU = 106 m2 s-1 K kg-1). This is (0.3 +- 0.5) km lower than the radar tropopause during DJFMA and (0.5 +- 1.0) km lower during JJASO. The radar, potential vorticity and ozone tropopauses decrease in altitude during increasingly strong cyclonic conditions, in contrast to the radiosonde WMO tropopause which remains nearly constant. During strong JJASO cyclonic conditions, there are large (several km) differences between WMO tropopause altitudes and radar tropopause altitudes. A seasonal cycle in tropopause fold occurrence is observed, with approximately a three-fold increase during JJASO.},

abstract = {A consistent body of experimental evidence from work of other groups is presented in support of the novel, theoretically based, isoprene oxidation mechanism we recently proposed to rationalize the unexpectedly high OH concentrations observed over areas with high isoprene emissions. Some explicit or implicit criticisms on the new mechanism are addressed. A particular photochemical mechanism is newly proposed for the OH-regenerating photolysis of the crucial hydroperoxy-methyl-butenals (HPALDs), formed by isomerisation of the initial isoprene hydroxy-peroxy radicals, that rationalizes a quantum yield close to 1. A similar photolysis mechanism of the resulting photolabile peroxy-acid-aldehydes (PACALDs) is shown to generate ample additional OH. Global modeling demonstrates the major importance of the new chemistry for the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere over continents. The globally averaged yield of the HPALDs in the oxidation of isoprene by OH is estimated to be of the order of 0.6. The isomerisation reactions of isoprene peroxy radicals are found to result in modelled [OH] increases in the planetary boundary layer by up to a factor of 3, in agreement with the reported observations as in the Amazon basin.},

abstract = {The global influence on tropospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) emitted by fossil fuel combustion may be strongly modulated by nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) chemistry taking place in the continental boundary layer. This effect is investigated using a three-dimensional, continental-scale model of tropospheric O-3-NOx-NMHC chemistry over North America in summer. The model includes detailed representation of NMHC chemistry including in particular isoprene. Model results are evaluated with observations for ozone,reactive nitrogen species, and photochemical tracers at a number of sites in North America. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to explore the effects of assumptions regarding the aerosol chemistry of peroxy radicals and the fate of hydroxy organic nitrates produced from the oxidation of isoprene. A budget analysis for the United States in the model indicates that 9% of NOx emitted from fossil fuel combustion is exported out of the continental boundary layer as NOx, 3.5% is exported as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and 3.7% is exported as other organic nitrates. Isoprene is the principal NMHC responsible for the formation and export of organic nitrates, which eventually decompose to provide a source of NOx in the remote troposphere. Export of NOx and organic nitrates from the U.S. boundary layer is found to be a major source of NOx on the scale of the northern hemisphere troposphere and on the scale of the upper troposphere at northern midlatitudes. Proper representation of isoprene chemistry in the continental boundary layer is important for simulation of NOx in global tropospheric chemistry models.},

We present evidence from controlled smog chamber experiments and field measurements that in the presence of high levels of nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2) typical of urban atmospheres, 2-methyloxirane-2-carboxylic acid (methacrylic acid epoxide, MAE) is a precursor to known iso-prene-derived SOA tracers, and ultimately to SOA. We propose that MAE arises from decomposition of the OH adduct of metha-cryloylperoxynitrate (MPAN). This hypothesis is supported by the similarity of SOA constituents derived from MAE to those from photooxidation of isoprene, methacrolein, and MPAN under high-NO x conditions. Strong support is further derived from com-putational chemistry calculations and Community Multiscale Air Quality model simulations, yielding predictions consistent with field observations. Field measurements taken in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, considered along with the modeling results indicate the atmospheric significance and relevance of MAE chemistry across the United States, especially in urban areas heavily impacted by isoprene emissions. Identification of MAE implies a major role of atmospheric epoxides in forming SOA from isoprene photooxida-tion. Updating current atmospheric modeling frameworks with MAE chemistry could improve the way that SOA has been attrib-uted to isoprene based on ambient tracer measurements, and lead to SOA parameterizations that better capture the dependency of yield on NO x . air pollution | anthropogenic | biogenic | particulate matter | fine aerosol I soprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, C 5 H 8) is released by terres-trial vegetation in an estimated quantity of 600 teragram-yr −1 (Tg-yr −1) (1) and represents the largest single nonmethane hy-drocarbon emission into Earth's atmosphere. Photooxidation of isoprene by hydroxyl radicals (OH) during the daytime (2) has been identified as a source of tropospheric ozone (O 3) (3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (4–11). Recent work has shown that anthropogenic pollutants, particularly mixtures of nitrogen oxides (NO x = NO + NO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), greatly enhance isoprene as a source of SOA (5, 6, 8, 10, 11). While isoprene is thought to be a substantial contributor to global SOA (12, 13), the mechanism by which isoprene-derived SOA is formed and the influence of environmental conditions on SOA formation remain unclear, but are critical to developing PM 2.5 control strategies for protection of public health and to assessing the impact on the climate system. Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations indicate that re-moval of controllable anthropogenic emissions could affect a reduction of greater than 50% in biogenic SOA in the eastern United States (14). NO x -dependent chemical pathways have been proposed to ex-plain isoprene-derived SOA tracers common to both laboratory-generated and organic aerosols in atmospheres typical of the urban environment (15). SOA formation from isoprene under high-NO x conditions has been ascribed to the oxidation of methacryloylperoxynitrate (MPAN) (10, 16), which laboratory studies have established as a second-generation oxidation prod-uct of isoprene (17, 18). High NO 2 /NO ratios favor formation of MPAN from both isoprene and methacrolein (MACR) photo-oxidation and result in enhanced SOA yields (10, 16). Identifi-cation of similar chemical constituents in SOA produced from the photooxidation of isoprene, MACR, and MPAN further supports the central role of MPAN oxidation under these con-ditions (10). Mass spectrometric analysis of oligoesters and their mono nitrated and sulfated derivatives from SOA generated in the high NO 2 /NO chamber experiments yields a series of product ions separated by 102 Da, suggesting a common monomeric unit. While a mechanism of oligoester formation remains to be de-termined, the observation of a common monomeric unit is in accord with a critical single gas-phase intermediate from MPAN photooxidation as an oligoester precursor (10). The mechanism proposed in Fig. 1 for SOA formation from the photooxidation of isoprene in the presence of NO x shows the published route to MPAN via the H-abstraction channel of the branching reaction of MACR with OH (17–19). The fate of the transient resulting from the addition of OH to MPAN, how-ever, has until recently been a matter of conjecture. Kjaergaard et al. (20) have reported a computational study suggesting that the transient OH adduct of MPAN (HOMPAN) reacts by elimination of nitrate radical (NO 3) followed by an intramolecular rear-rangement to hydroxymethylmethyl-$\alpha$-lactone (HMML), which is suggested as the precursor of known high-NO x SOA compounds and oligoesters. In Fig. 1 we suggest a second parallel, thermo-dynamically feasible pathway via rearrangement of HOMPAN to methacrylic acid epoxide (MAE), which yields known high-NO x SOA marker compounds and oligoesters similar to those pre-viously reported from photooxidation of isoprene, MACR, and MPAN (10, 16, 21). This study presents experimental evidence supported by computational and modeling studies that the most},

abstract = {Eucalypts are among the highest emitters of biogenic volatile organic compounds, yet there is relatively little data available from field studies of this genus. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes and the short-chained carbonyls formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone were determined from four species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus grandis, and Eucalytpus viminalis) in Australia. A smaller comparative study was conducted on E. camaldulensis in south-eastern Australia. Carbonyl emissions, reported here for the first time from eucalypts, were generally comparable with rates reported for other species, with diurnal emissions peaking at about 4, 75 and 34??nmol??m-2??min-1 for acetone, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively. There was wide variation in diurnal isoprene and monoterpene emissions between species, but under standard conditions, isoprene emissions were much lower than previous reports. Conversely, standard emission rates of monoterpenes were as much as six times greater than previous reports for some species. Emission of each carbonyl was correlated with its ambient concentration across different species, but more weakly related to temperature. Acetaldehyde emission in particular was significantly correlated with transpiration, but not with sap flow or with ethanol concentrations in xylem sap, suggesting fermentation within the leaf and stomatal conductance are primary controlling processes. Differences in acetaldehyde exchange velocities between sites, in addition to transpiration differences, suggest stomata may indeed exert long term emission regulation, in contrast to compounds for which no biological sink exists. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are a chief uncertainty in calculating the burdens of important atmospheric compounds like tropospheric ozone or secondary organic aerosol, reflecting either imperfect chemical oxidation mechanisms or unreliable emission estimates, or both. To provide a starting point for a more systematic discussion we review here global isoprene and monoterpene emission estimates to-date. We note a surprisingly small variation in the predictions of global isoprene emission rate that is in stark contrast with our lack of process understanding and the small number of observations for model parameterisation and evaluation. Most of 10 the models are based on similar emission algorithms, using fixed values for the emission capacity of various plant functional types. In some studies these values are very similar, but they differ substantially in others. The models differ also broadly with regard to their representation of net primary productivity, method of biome coverage determination and climate data. Their similarities with regard to the global isoprene emission rate would suggest that the dominant parameters driving the ultimate global estimate, and thus the dominant determinant of model sensitivity, are the specific emission algorithm and isoprene emission capacity. Contrary to isoprene, monoterpene estimates show significantly larger model-to-model variation although variation in terms of leaf algorithm, emission capacities, the way of model upscaling, vegetation cover or climatology used in terpene models are comparable to those used for isoprene. From our summary of published studies there appears to be no evidence that the terrestrial modelling community has been any more successful in “resolving unknowns” in the mechanisms that control global isoprene emissions, compared to global monoterpene emissions. Rather, the proliferation of common parameterization schemes within a 25 large variety of model platforms lends the illusion of convergence towards a common estimate of global isoprene emissions. This convergence might be used to provide optimism that the community has reached the “relief phase”, the phase when sufficient process understanding and data for evaluation allows for models to converge, when applying a recently proposed concept. We argue that there is no basis for this apparent “relief” phase. Rather, we urge modellers to be bolder in their analysis to draw attention to the fact that terrestrial emissions, particularly in the area of biome-specific emission capacities, are unknown rather than uncertain.},

Despite considerable sam-pling differences, NO 2 vertical column densities from OMI are modestly correlated (r = 0.3–0.8) with in situ measure-ments of tropospheric NO 2 from aircraft, ground-based ob-servations of NO 2 columns from MAX-DOAS and Pandora instruments, in situ surface NO 2 measurements from pho-tolytic converter instruments, and a bottom-up NO x emis-sion inventory. Overall, OMI retrievals tend to be lower in urban regions and higher in remote areas, but generally agree with other measurements to within ± 20 %. No consistent seasonal bias is evident. Contrasting results between dif-ferent data sets reveal complexities behind NO 2 validation. Since validation data sets are scarce and are limited in space and time, validation of the global product is still limited in scope by spatial and temporal coverage and retrieval condi-tions. Monthly mean vertical NO 2 profile shapes from the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemistry-transport model (CTM) used in the OMI retrievals are highly consistent with in situ aircraft measurements, but these measured profiles exhibit considerable day-to-day variation, affecting the re-trieved daily NO 2 columns by up to 40 %. This assessment of OMI tropospheric NO 2 columns, together with the compar-ison of OMI-retrieved and model-simulated NO 2 columns, could offer diagnostic evaluation of the model.},

abstract = {Ozone pollution in the Southeast US involves complex chemistry driven by emissions of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide radicals (NO x ≡ NO + NO 2) and biogenic isoprene. Model estimates of surface ozone concentrations tend to be biased high in the region and this is of concern for designing effective emission control strategies to meet air quality standards. We use detailed chemical observations from the SEAC 4 RS aircraft campaign in August and Septem-ber 2013, interpreted with the GEOS-Chem chemical trans-port model at 0.25 x 0.3125 horizontal resolution, to bet-ter understand the factors controlling surface ozone in the Southeast US. We find that the National Emission Inven-tory (NEI) for NO x from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is too high. This finding is based on SEAC 4 RS observations of NO x and its oxidation products, surface net-work observations of nitrate wet deposition fluxes, and OMI satellite observations of tropospheric NO 2 columns. Our re-sults indicate that NEI NO x emissions from mobile and in-dustrial sources must be reduced by 30–60 %, dependent on the assumption of the contribution by soil NO x emissions. Upper-tropospheric NO 2 from lightning makes a large con-tribution to satellite observations of tropospheric NO 2 that must be accounted for when using these data to estimate sur-face NO x emissions. We find that only half of isoprene oxi-dation proceeds by the high-NO x pathway to produce ozone; this fraction is only moderately sensitive to changes in NOx Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the emissions because isoprene and NOx emissions are spatially segregated. GEOS-Chem with reduced NO x emissions pro-vides an unbiased simulation of ozone observations from the aircraft and reproduces the observed ozone production effi-ciency in the boundary layer as derived from a regression of ozone and NO x oxidation products. However, the model is still biased high by 6 +- 14 ppb relative to observed sur-face ozone in the Southeast US. Ozonesondes launched dur-ing midday hours show a 7 ppb ozone decrease from 1.5 km to the surface that GEOS-Chem does not capture. This bias may reflect a combination of excessive vertical mixing and net ozone production in the model boundary layer.},

abstract = {Drought is a recurring extreme of the climate sys-tem with well-documented impacts on agriculture and water resources. The strong perturbation of drought to the land bio-sphere and atmospheric water cycle will affect atmospheric composition, the nature and extent of which are not well un-derstood. Here we present observational evidence that US air quality is significantly correlated with drought severity. Se-vere droughts during the period of 1990–2014 were found associated with growth-season (March–October) mean en-hancements in surface ozone and PM 2.5 of 3.5 ppbv (8 %) and 1.6 µg m −3 (17 %), respectively. The pollutant enhance-ments associated with droughts do not appear to be affected by the decreasing trend of US anthropogenic emissions, in-dicating natural processes as the primary cause. Elevated ozone and PM 2.5 are attributed to the combined effects of drought on deposition, natural emissions (wildfires, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), and dust), and chem-istry. Most climate–chemistry models are not able to re-produce the observed correlations of ozone and PM 2.5 to drought severity. The model deficiencies are partly attributed to the lack of drought-induced changes in land–atmosphere exchanges of reactive gases and particles and misrepresenta-tion of cloud changes under drought conditions. By apply-ing the observed relationships between drought and air pol-lutants to climate model projected drought occurrences, we estimate an increase of 1–6 % for ground-level O 3 and 1– 16 % for PM 2.5 in the US by 2100 compared to the 2000s due to increasing drought alone. Drought thus poses an im-portant aspect of climate change penalty on air quality, and a better prediction of such effects would require improvements in model processes.},

abstract = {Contributions of various anthropogenic sources to the secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) in Europe as well as the role of biogenic emissions on SIA formation were investigated using the three-dimensional regional model CAMx (comprehensive air quality model with extensions). Simulations were carried out for two periods of EMEP field campaigns, February–March 2009 and June 2006, which are representative of cold and warm seasons, respectively. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are known mainly as precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but their role on inorganic aerosol formation has not attracted much attention so far. In this study, we showed the importance of the chemical reactions of BVOCs and how they affect the oxidant concentrations, leading to significant changes, especially in the formation of ammonium nitrate. A sensitivity test with doubled BVOC emissions in Europe during the warm season showed a large increase in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations (by about a factor of two), while particulate inorganic nitrate concentrations decreased by up to 35 %, leading to a better agreement between the model results and measurements. Sulfate concentrations decreased as well; the change, however, was smaller. The changes in inorganic nitrate and sulfate concentrations occurred at different locations in Europe, indicating the importance of precursor gases and biogenic emission types for the negative correlation between BVOCs and SIA. Further analysis of the data suggested that reactions of the additional terpenes with nitrate radicals at night were responsible for the decline in inorganic nitrate formation, whereas oxidation of BVOCs with OH radicals led to a decrease in sulfate. Source apportionment results suggest that the main anthropogenic source of precursors leading to formation of particulate inorganic nitrate is road transport (SNAP7; see Table 1 for a description of the categories), whereas combustion in energy and transformation industries (SNAP1) was the most important contributor to sulfate particulate mass. Emissions from international shipping were also found to be very important for both nitrate and sulfate formation in Europe. In addition, we also examined contributions from the geographical source regions to SIA concentrations in the most densely populated region of Switzerland, the Swiss Plateau.},

abstract = {Understanding uncertainty is essential for utilizing atmospheric VOC measurements in robust ways to develop atmospheric science. This study describes an inter-comparison of the VOC data, and the derived uncertainty estimates, measured with three independent techniques (PTR-MS, AT-GC-FID and DNPH-HPLC) during the Sydney Particle Study campaigns in 2012. The compounds and compound classes compared, based on objective selection criteria from the available data, were: benzene, toluene, C8 aromatics, isoprene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone. Bottom-up uncertainty analyses were undertaken for each compound and each measurement system. Top-down uncertainties were quantified via the inter-comparisons. Four metrics were used for the inter-comparisons: the slope and intercept as determined by reduced major axis regression, the correlation, and the root mean standard deviation of the observation from the regression line. In all seven comparisons the correlations between independent measurement techniques were high with R2 values of median 0.93 (range: 0.72&ndash;0.98) and small root mean standard deviations of the observations from the regression line with a median of 0.13 (range: 0.04&ndash;0.23&thinsp;ppb). These results give a high degree of confidence that for each comparison the response of the two independent techniques are dominated by the same constituents. The slope and intercept as determined by reduced major axis regression gives a different story. The slopes varied considerably with a median of 1.23 and range 1.08 to 2.03. The intercepts varied with a median of 0.02 and range &minus;0.07 to 0.31&thinsp;ppb. An ideal comparison would give a slope of 1.00 and an intercept of zero. This analysis identified some poorly understood and poorly quantified sources of uncertainty in the measurement techniques including: the contributions of non-target compounds to the measurement of the target compound for benzene, toluene and isoprene by PTR-MS; and, the under-reporting of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetone by the DNPH technique. As well as these, this study has identified a specific interference of liquid water with acetone measurements by the DNPH technique. These relationships reported for Sydney 2012 were incorporated into a larger analysis with 61 other published inter-comparison studies for the same compounds. Overall for the light aromatics, isoprene and the C1&ndash;C3 carbonyls the uncertainty in a set of measurements varies by a factor of between 1.5 and two. These uncertainties ($\sim$50&thinsp;%) are significantly higher than uncertainties estimated using standard propagation of error methods, which in this case were $\sim$22&thinsp;% or less, and are the result of the presence of poorly understood or neglected processes that affect the measurement and its uncertainty. The uncertainties in VOC measurements identified here should be considered when: assessing the reliability of VOC measurements from individual instruments; when utilising VOC data to constrain and inform air quality and climate models; when using VOC observations for human exposure studies; and, when comparing ambient VOC data with satellite retrievals.},

In this paper, the emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes from Australian vegetation are investigated for the first time using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGANv2.1); the CSIRO chemical transport model; and atmospheric observations of isoprene, monoterpenes and isoprene oxidation products (methacrolein and methyl vinyl ketone). Observations from four field campaigns during three different seasons are used, covering urban, coastal suburban and inland forest areas. The observed concentrations of isoprene and monoterpenes were of a broadly similar magnitude, which may indicate that southeast Australia holds an unusual position where neither chemical species dominates. The model results overestimate the observed atmospheric concentrations of isoprene (up to a factor of 6) and underestimate the monoterpene concentrations (up to a factor of 4). This may occur because the emission rates currently used in MEGANv2.1 for Australia are drawn mainly from young eucalypt trees (< 7 years), which may emit more isoprene than adult trees. There is no single increase/decrease factor for the emissions which suits all seasons and conditions studied. There is a need for further field measurements of in situ isoprene and monoterpene emission fluxes in Australia.},

abstract = {[1] Gas-phase mechanisms provide important oxidant and gaseous precursors for secondary aerosol formation. Different gas-phase mechanisms may lead to different predictions of gases, aerosols, and aerosol direct and indirect effects. In this study, WRF/Chem-MADRID simulations are conducted over the continental United States for July 2001, with three different gas-phase mechanisms, a default one (i.e., CBM-Z) and two newly implemented ones (i.e., CB05 and SAPRC-99). Simulation results are evaluated against available surface observations, satellite data, and reanalysis data. The model with these three gas-phase mechanisms gives similar predictions of most meteorological variables in terms of spatial distribution and statistics, but large differences exist in shortwave radiation and temperature and relative humidity at 2 m at individual sites under cloudy conditions, indicating the importance of aerosol semi-direct and indirect effects on these variables. Large biases exist in the simulated wind speed at 10 m, cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and precipitation, due to uncertainties in current cloud microphysics and surface layer parameterizations. Simulations with all three gas-phase mechanisms well reproduce surface concentrations of O3, CO, NO2, and PM2.5, and column NO2. Larger biases exist in the surface concentrations of nitrate and organic matter (OM) and in the spatial distribution of column CO, tropospheric ozone residual, and aerosol optical depth, due to uncertainties in primary OM emissions, limitations in model representations of chemical transport, and radiative processes. Different gas-phase mechanisms lead to different predictions of mass concentrations of O3 (up to 5 ppb), PM2.5 (up to 0.5 $\mu$g m−3), secondary inorganic PM2.5 species (up to 1.1 $\mu$g m−3), organic PM (up to 1.8 $\mu$g m−3), and number concentration of PM2.5 (up to 2 × 104 cm−3). Differences in aerosol mass and number concentrations further lead to sizeable differences in simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) due to the feedback mechanisms among H2SO4 vapor, PM2.5 number, CCN, and CDNC through gas-phase chemistry, new particle formation via homogeneous nucleation, aerosol growth, and aerosol activation by cloud droplets. This study illustrates the important impact of gas-phase mechanisms on chemical and aerosol predictions, their subsequent effects on meteorological predictions, and a need for an accurate representation of such feedbacks through various atmospheric processes in the model. The online-coupled models that simulate feedbacks between meteorological variables and chemical species may provide more accurate representations of the real atmosphere for regulatory applications and can be applied to simulate chemistry-climate feedbacks over a longer period of time.},

abstract = {Alkyl nitrates and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) produced during the oxidation of isoprene by ni-trate radicals has been observed in the SAPHIR (Simulation of Atmospheric PHotochemistry In a large Reaction Cham-ber) chamber. A 16 h dark experiment was conducted with temperatures at 289–301 K, and maximum concentrations of 11 ppb isoprene, 62.4 ppb O 3 and 31.1 ppb NO x . We find the yield of nitrates is 70±8% from the isoprene + NO 3 reaction, and the yield for secondary dinitrates produced in the reaction of primary isoprene nitrates with NO 3 is 40±20%. We find an effective rate constant for reaction of NO 3 with the group of first generation oxidation products to be 7×10 −14 molecule −1 cm 3 s −1 . At the low total organic aerosol concentration in the chamber (max=0.52 µg m −3) we observed a mass yield (SOA mass/isoprene mass) of 2% for the entire 16 h experiment. However a comparison of the timing of the observed SOA production to a box model simulation of first and second generation oxidation prod-ucts shows that the yield from the first generation products was <0.7% while the further oxidation of the initial prod-ucts leads to a yield of 14% (defined as SOA/isoprene 2x where isoprene 2x is the mass of isoprene which reacted twice with NO 3). The SOA yield of 14% is consistent with equilibrium partitioning of highly functionalized C 5 products of isoprene oxidation.},

abstract = {Several studies have observed midtropospheric atmospheric composition anomalies and suggested a link to tropical biomass burning. Such anomalies complicate the use of trace gas profiles in remote regions to infer their surface sources/sinks based on the vertical gradients. The Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) campaign in Africa and coordinated downwind measurements in Australia provided an opportunity to confirm this link and elucidate the specific surface and atmospheric processes. Five aircraft missions were conducted by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Atmospheric Research during the campaign. They were scheduled after African outflows of polluted air were observed in satellite images over the Indian Ocean flowing east toward Australia. Air samples collected from near the surface to 7 km were analyzed for a suite of trace gases ( 12CO 2, CH 4, CO, H 2, N 2O, and C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons) and one isotopomer ( 13CO 2 to provide vertical composition profiles. Ozone was monitored continuously during flight while a groundbased lidar was employed in the Melbourne region to detect aerosol layers. A preliminary statistical analysis on the Australian data confirms covarying midroposphere enhancements in the biomass burning products. Making rudimentary corrections for photochemical evolution during transit, the trace gas enhancement ratios in affected air samples are comparable to emission ratios in fresh biomass burning plumes. The 13CO 2/ 12CO 2 ratios are also consistent with a source from terrestrial plants. Back-trajectory analysis for strongly enhanced samples suggests long-range transport from tropical regions in Africa or South America, the proof of which requires a follow-on analysis with a global chemistry transport model.},

abstract = {Ozone production in global chemical models is dependent on model resolution because ozone chemistry is inherently nonlinear, the timescales for chemical production are short, and precursors are artificially distributed over the spatial scale of the model grid. In this study we examine the sensitivity of ozone, its precursors, and its production to resolution by running a global chemical transport model at four different resolutions between T21 (5.6x5.6) and T106 (1.1x1.1) and by quantifying the errors in regional and global budgets. The sensitivity to vertical mixing through the parameterization of boundary layer turbulence is also examined. We find less ozone production in the boundary layer at higher resolution, consistent with slower chemical production in polluted emission regions and greater export of precursors. Agreement with ozonesonde and aircraft measurements made during the NASA TRACE-P campaign over the western Pacific in spring 2001 is consistently better at higher resolution. We demonstrate that the numerical errors in transport processes on a given resolution converge geometrically for a tracer at successively higher resolutions. The convergence in ozone production on progressing from T21 to T42, T63, and T106 resolution is likewise monotonic but indicates that there are still large errors at 120 km scales, suggesting that T106 resolution is too coarse to resolve regional ozone production. Diagnosing the ozone production and precursor transport that follow a short pulse of emissions over east Asia in springtime allows us to quantify the impacts of resolution on both regional and global ozone. Production close to continental emission regions is overestimated by 27% at T21 resolution, by 13% at T42 resolution, and by 5% at T106 resolution. However, subsequent ozone production in the free troposphere is not greatly affected. We find that the export of short-lived precursors such as NO x by convection is overestimated at coarse resolution.},

abstract = {We use formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column measurements from the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and a nested-grid version of the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model, to infer an ensemble of top-down isoprene emission estimates from tropical South America during 2006, using different model configurations and assumptions in the HCHO air-mass factor (AMF) calculation. Scenes affected by biomass burning are removed on a daily basis using fire count observations, and we use the local model sensitivity to identify locations where the impact of spatial smearing is small, though this comprises spatial coverage over the region. We find that the use of the HCHO column data more tightly constrains the ensemble isoprene emission range from 27-61TgC to 31-38TgC for SCIAMACHY, and 45-104TgC to 28-38TgC for OMI. Median uncertainties of the top-down emissions are about 60-260% for SCIAMACHY, and 10-90% for OMI. We find that the inferred emissions are most sensitive to uncertainties in cloud fraction and cloud top pressure (differences of +/- 10%), the a priori isoprene emissions (+/- 20%), and the HCHO vertical column retrieval (+/- 30%). Construction of continuous top-down emission maps generally improves GEOS-Chem's simulation of HCHO columns over the region, with respect to both the SCIAMACHY and OMI data. However, if local time top-down emissions are scaled to monthly mean values, the annual emission inferred from SCIAMACHY are nearly twice those from OMI. This difference cannot be explained by the different sampling of the sensors or uncertainties in the AMF calculation.},

Recommendations are provided for CB6r2 and incorporated into new mechanism CB6r2-UMD. Simulated HCHO impacts modeled ozone production rates. Isoprene oxidation schemes vary greatly among gas-phase chemical mechanisms, with potentially sig-nificant ramifications for air quality modeling and interpretation of satellite observations in biogenic-rich regions. In this study, in situ observations from the 2013 SENEX mission are combined with a constrained 0-D photochemical box model to evaluate isoprene chemistry among five commonly used gas-phase chemical mechanisms: CB05, CB6r2, MCMv3.2, MCMv3.3.1, and a recent version of GEOS-Chem. Mech-anisms are evaluated and inter-compared with respect to formaldehyde (HCHO), a high-yield product of isoprene oxidation. Though underestimated by all considered mechanisms, observed HCHO mixing ratios are best reproduced by MCMv3.3.1 (normalized mean bias ($\sim$15%), followed by GEOS-Chem ($\sim$17%), MCMv3.2 ($\sim$25%), CB6r2 ($\sim$32%) and CB05 ($\sim$33%). Inter-comparison of HCHO production rates reveals that major restructuring of the isoprene oxidation scheme in the Carbon Bond mechanism increases HCHO production by only $\sim$5% in CB6r2 relative to CB05, while further refinement of the complex isoprene scheme in the Master Chemical Mechanism increases HCHO production by $\sim$16% in MCMv3.3.1 relative to MCMv3.2. The GEOS-Chem mechanism provides a good approximation of the explicit isoprene chemistry in MCMv3.3.1 and generally reproduces the magnitude and source distribution of HCHO production rates. We analytically derive improvements to the isoprene scheme in CB6r2 and incorporate these changes into a new mechanism called CB6r2-UMD, which is designed to preserve computational efficiency. The CB6r2-UMD mechanism mimics production of HCHO in MCMv3.3.1 and demonstrates},

Similar results were obtained with a lower-resolution version of the model. The effects on rainfall were already important on day 3 of the integration over the anomaly area and on day 6 over parts of Scandinavia outside the anomaly area. The experiment was repeated with a version of the model in which the prevailing flow over Europe was less weak with increased moist westerly flow from the Atlantic. In this case the dry anomaly persisted for only about 20 days before it became too weak to affect the evaporation significantly.},

abstract = {<p>Atmospheric pollutants have both beneficial and detrimental effects on carbon uptake by land ecosystems. Surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) damages leaf photosynthesis by oxidizing plant cells, while aerosols promote carbon uptake by increasing diffuse radiation and exert additional influences through concomitant perturbations to meteorology and hydrology. China is currently the world's largest emitter of both carbon dioxide and short-lived air pollutants. The land ecosystems of China are estimated to provide a carbon sink, but it remains unclear whether air pollution acts to inhibit or promote carbon uptake. Here, we employ Earth system modeling and multiple measurement datasets to assess the separate and combined effects of anthropogenic O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol pollution on net primary productivity (NPP) in China. In the present day, O<sub>3</sub> reduces annual NPP by 0.6 Pg C (14 %) with a range from 0.4 Pg C (low O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity) to 0.8 Pg C (high O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity). In contrast, aerosol direct effects increase NPP by 0.2 Pg C (5 %) through the combination of diffuse radiation fertilization, reduced canopy temperatures, and reduced evaporation leading to higher soil moisture. Consequently, the net effects of O<sub>3</sub> and aerosols decrease NPP by 0.4 Pg C (9 %) with a range from 0.2 Pg C (low O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity) to 0.6 Pg C (high O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity). However, precipitation inhibition from combined aerosol direct and indirect effects reduces annual NPP by 0.2 Pg C (4 %), leading to a net air pollution suppression of 0.8 Pg C (16 %) with a range from 0.6 Pg C (low O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity) to 1.0 Pg C (high O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity). Our results reveal strong dampening effects of air pollution on the land carbon uptake in China today. Following the current legislation emission scenario, this suppression will be further increased by the year 2030, mainly due to a continuing increase in surface O<sub>3</sub>. However, the maximum technically feasible reduction scenario could drastically relieve the current level of NPP damage by 70 % in 2030, offering protection of this critical ecosystem service and the mitigation of long-term global warming.</p>},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for the retrieval of glyoxal from backscattered solar radiation, and apply it to spectra measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The algorithm is based on direct spectrum fitting, and adopts a two-step fitting routine to account for liquid water absorption. Previous studies have shown that glyoxal retrieval algorithms are highly sensitive to the position of the spectral fit window. This dependence was systematically tested on real and simulated OMI spectra. We find that a combination of errors resulting from uncertainties in reference cross sections and spectral features associated with the Ring effect are consistent with the fit-window dependence observed in real spectra. This implies an optimal fitting window of 435–461 nm, consistent with previous satellite glyoxal retrievals. The results from the retrieval of simulated spectra also support previous findings that have suggested that glyoxal is sensitive to NO2 cross-section temperature. The retrieval window limits of the liquid water retrieval are also tested. A retrieval window 385–470 nm reduces interference with strong spectral features associated with sand. We show that cross-track dependent offsets (stripes) present in OMI can be corrected using offsets derived from retrieved slant columns over the Sahara, and apply the correction to OMI data. Average glyoxal columns are on average lower than those of previous studies likely owing to the choice of reference sector for offset correction. OMI VCDs (vertical column densities)are lower compared to other satellites over the tropics and Asia during the monsoon season, suggesting that the new retrieval is less sensitive to water vapour abundance. Consequently we do not see significant glyoxal enhancements over tropical oceans. OMI-derived glyoxal-to-formaldehyde ratios over biogenic and anthropogenic source regions are consistent with surface observations.},

abstract = {We use a large laboratory, modeling, and field dataset to investigate the isoprene + O3 reaction, with the goal of better understanding the fates of the C1 and C4 Criegee intermediates in the atmosphere. Although ozonolysis can produce several distinct Criegee intermediates, the C1 stabilized Criegee (CH2OO, 61 ± 9%) is the only one observed to react bimolecularly. We suggest that the C4 Criegees have a low stabilization fraction and propose pathways for their decomposition. Both prompt and non-prompt reactions are important in the production of OH (28% ± 5%) and formaldehyde (81% ± 16%). The yields of unimolecular products (OH, formaldehyde, methacrolein (42 ± 6%) and methyl vinyl ketone (18 ± 6%)) are fairly insensitive to water, i.e., changes in yields in response to water vapor (≤4% absolute) are within the error of the analysis. We propose a comprehensive reaction mechanism that can be incorporated into atmospheric models, which reproduces laboratory data over a wide range of relative humidities. The mechanism proposes that CH2OO + H2O (k(H2O) ∼ 1 × 10−15 cm3 molec−1 s−1) yields 73% hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP), 6% formaldehyde + H2O2, and 21% formic acid + H2O; and CH2OO + (H2O)2 (k(H2O)2 ∼ 1 × 10−12 cm3 molec−1 s−1) yields 40% HMHP, 6% formaldehyde + H2O2, and 54% formic acid + H2O. Competitive rate determinations (kSO2/k(H2O)n=1,2 ∼ 2.2 (±0.3) × 104) and field observations suggest that water vapor is a sink for greater than 98% of CH2OO in a Southeastern US forest, even during pollution episodes ([SO2] ∼ 10 ppb). The importance of the CH2OO + (H2O)n reaction is demonstrated by high HMHP mixing ratios observed over the forest canopy. We find that CH2OO does not substantially affect the lifetime of SO2 or HCOOH in the Southeast US, e.g., CH2OO + SO2 reaction is a minor contribution (<6%) to sulfate formation. Extrapolating, these results imply that sulfate production by stabilized Criegees is likely unimportant in regions dominated by the reactivity of ozone with isoprene. In contrast, hydroperoxide, organic acid, and formaldehyde formation from isoprene ozonolysis in those areas may be significant.},

abstract = {We examine upcoming geostationary satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column densities (VCDs) in East Asia and the retrieval sensitivity to the temporal variation of air mass factors (AMFs) considering the presence of aerosols. Observation system simulation experiments (OSSE) were conducted using a combination of a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), a radiative transfer model (VLIDORT), and a HCHO retrieval algorithm developed for the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), which will be launched in 2019. Application of the retrieval algorithm to simulated hourly radiances yields the retrieved HCHO VCDs, which are then compared with the GEOS-Chem HCHO VCDs as true values for the evaluation of the retrieval algorithm. In order to examine the retrieval sensitivity to the temporal variation of AMF, we examine three AMF specifications, AMFm, AMFh, and AMFmh, using monthly, hourly, and monthly mean hourly input data for their calculation, respectively. We compare the retrieved HCHO VCDs using those three AMFs and find that the HCHO VCDs with AMFh are in better agreement with the true values than the results using AMFmh and AMFm. AMFmh reflects diurnal variation of planetary boundary layer and other meteorological parameters, so that the results with AMFmh show a better performance than those with AMFm. The differences between AMFh and AMFm range from ?0.76 to 0.74 in absolute value and are mainly caused by temporal changes in aerosol chemical compositions and aerosol vertical distributions, which result in ?27 to 58 and ?34 to 43?% changes in HCHO VCDs over China, respectively, compared to HCHO VCDs using AMFm. We apply our calculated AMF table together with OMI aerosol optical properties to OMI HCHO products in March 2006, when Asian dust storms occurred, and find ?32 to 47?% changes in the retrieved HCHO columns due to temporal changes in aerosol optical properties in East Asia. The impact of aerosol temporal variability cannot be neglected for future geostationary observations.},

Tropopause fold events in EMAC simulations were identified with a 3-D labeling algorithm that detects folds at grid points where multiple crossings of the dynamical tropopause are computed. Subsequently the events featuring the largest horizontal and vertical extent were selected for further study. For the selection of these events we identified a significant contribution of the stratospheric ozone reser-voir to the high concentrations of ozone in the middle and lower free troposphere over the EMME. A distinct increase of ozone is found over the EMME in the middle troposphere during summer as a result of the fold activity, shifting to-wards the southeast and decreasing altitude. We find that the interannual variability of near-surface ozone over the eastern Mediterranean (EM) during summer is related to that of both tropopause folds and ozone in the free troposphere.},

The most significant and new observation reported is the increase in the upper-tropospheric (10–16 km) ozone by 20–50 ppbv, which has extended down to the middle (6–10 km) and lower tropo-sphere (< 6 km). The descent rate of enhanced ozone layer during the passage of tropical cyclone is 0.8–1 km day −1 , which is three times that of a clear-sky day (non-convective). Enhancement of surface ozone concentration by ∼ 10 ppbv in the daytime and 10–15 ppbv in the night-time is observed during a cyclone. Potential vorticity, vertical velocity and potential temperature obtained from numerical simulation, reproduces the key feature of the observations. A simula-tion study indicates the downward transport of stratospheric air into the troposphere. Space-borne observations of rela-tive humidity indicate the presence of sporadic dry air in the upper and middle troposphere over the cyclonic region. These observations quantitatively constitute experimental ev-idence of redistribution of stratospheric ozone during cy-clonic storms.},

abstract = {Cross-tropopause transport of O3 is a significant factor in the tropospheric budget and distribution of O3. Nevertheless, the distribution in the troposphere of O3 that originates from the stratosphere is uncertain. We study this with a chemistry — general circulation model with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. The model simulates background tropospheric CH4-CO-NOx-HOx photochemistry, and includes a tracer for stratospheric O3. Since this tracer is not photochemically produced in the troposphere but only destroyed, comparing its budget and distribution with that of total tropospheric O3 yields an estimate of the contribution of the stratospheric O3 source in the troposphere. Model results suggest that transport from the stratosphere and net photochemical formation in the troposphere, considering present-day emissions, are of comparable magnitude. The model predicts efficient transport of upper tropospheric O3-rich air to the surface by large-scale subsidence in the subtropics and by synoptic disturbances in the NH middle and high latitudes. O3 from the stratosphere contributes significantly to surface O3 in winter and spring when the photochemical lifetime of O3 is relatively long. In summer and in the tropics, little O3 from the stratosphere reaches the surface due to strong photochemical destruction, so that surface O3 is largely determined by photochemical production. Photochemically produced O3 maximizes in the free troposphere where the O3 surface warming efficiency is higher compared to the boundary layer.},

abstract = {A global ECMWF data set comprising ten years of daily routine T63 analyses is employed for the derivation of regional and temporal tropopause fold statistics. Due to the small scale of folds relative to grid resolution it was found to be convenient to identify them by joint occurrences of potential vorticity maxima and upper tropospheric Q-vector divergences as indicators. The applicability of the proposed method is shown by diagnostic studies of episodic mesoscale model simulations, with 40--50{\thinspace}km resolution as a basis for reference and comparison with the global data set. Tropopause folds are a frequent and rather uniformly occurring phenomenon of the extratropics pole-ward of 30{\textdegree} latitude. On the global scale, and based on daily counting, there are about 11{\thinspace}000 tropopause fold days per year. In order to account for the different folding depth and intensity a four step classification is proposed to define a tropopause fold activity by weighted sums, in terms of four intensity classes. Tropopause fold activity in the Northern Hemisphere is nearly twice as high and less homogeneously distributed as in the Southern Hemisphere, where only 62{\%} of the tropopause fold frequency is estimated. The frequency of tropopause folds is significantly smaller in the summer than in the other seasons.},

abstract = {The aircraft-based 2002 Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation experiment intercepted and chemically analyzed pollution plumes transported from Asia to the western United States. The research flight on 10–11 May 2002 detected mixing between polluted and stratospheric air at midtropospheric levels above the California coast. This study uses a Lagrangian domain-filling trajectory technique to illustrate that this event was the result of mixing between two warm conveyor belts (WCB) containing Asian pollution and the remnants of a deep tropopause fold from a downstream midlatitude cyclone (referred to as the stratospheric component of a dry airstream or SCDA). Advection of the trajectory particles shows how the SCDA decayed over 7.5 days. One component dispersed into a downstream WCB, while another component descended into the lower troposphere and became entrained by an upwind WCB. After 7.5 days of transport 22% of the SCDA mass was transported into the troposphere. The portions of the SCDA that penetrated to the lowest altitudes had the greatest likelihood of being transported into the troposphere. For example, over 90% of the SCDA at altitudes below the 600 hPa level was transported to the troposphere, but none of the mass at the 200 hPa level was exchanged. More than half of the exchange occurred during the first 48 hours as the deepest portions of the tropopause fold decayed over the Pacific. The rest of the exchange occurred over the following 5.5 days as the remnants of the SCDA sheared apart along the edge of the stratospheric polar vortex and became entrained into subsequent tropopause folds and vortex breakaway features. Stratosphere to troposphere exchange resulted in the transport of 0.5 Tg of stratospheric ozone to the troposphere during the 7.5 day study period. Roughly half of the SCDA particles that entered the troposphere dispersed into the upwind and downwind WCBs.},

abstract = {Isoprene photooxidation is a major driver of atmospheric chemistry over forested regions. Isoprene reacts with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and molecular oxygen to produce isoprene peroxy radicals (ISOPOO). These radicals can react with hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) to dominantly produce hydroxyhydroperoxides (ISOPOOH). They can also react with nitric oxide (NO) to largely produce methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR). Unimolecular isomerization and bimolecular reactions with organic peroxy radicals are also possible. There is uncertainty about the relative importance of each of these pathways in the atmosphere and possible changes because of anthropogenic pollution. Herein, measurements of ISOPOOH and MVK + MACR concentrations are reported over the central region of the Amazon basin during the wet season. The research site, downwind of an urban region, intercepted both background and polluted air masses during the GoAmazon2014/5 Experiment. Under background conditions, the confidence interval for the ratio of the ISOPOOH concentration to that of MVK + MACR spanned 0.4–0.6. This result implies a ratio of the reaction rate of ISOPOO with HO2 to that with NO of approximately unity. A value of unity is significantly smaller than simulated at present by global chemical transport models for this important, nominally low-NO, forested region of Earth. Under polluted conditions, when the concentrations of reactive nitrogen compounds were high (>1 ppb), ISOPOOH concentrations dropped below the instrumental detection limit (<60 ppt). This abrupt shift in isoprene photooxidation, sparked by human activities, speaks to ongoing and possible future changes in the photochemistry active over the Amazon rainforest.},

abstract = {Most satellite nadir ultraviolet and visible cloud, aerosol, and trace-gas algorithms make use of climatological surface reflectivity databases. For example, cloud and NO2 retrievals for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) use monthly gridded surface reflectivity climatologies that do not depend upon the observation geometry. In reality, reflection of incoming direct and diffuse solar light from land or ocean surfaces is sensitive to the sun–sensor geometry. This dependence is described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To account for the BRDF, we propose to use a new concept of geometry-dependent Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER). Implementation within the existing OMI cloud and NO2 retrieval infrastructure requires changes only to the input surface reflectivity database. The geometry-dependent LER is calculated using a vector radiative transfer model with high spatial resolution BRDF information from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over land and the Cox–Munk slope distribution over ocean with a contribution from water-leaving radiance. We compare the geometry-dependent and climatological LERs for two wavelengths, 354 and 466 nm, that are used in OMI cloud algorithms to derive cloud fractions. A detailed comparison of the cloud fractions and pressures derived with climatological and geometry-dependent LERs is carried out. Geometry-dependent LER and corresponding retrieved cloud products are then used as inputs to our OMI NO2 algorithm. We find that replacing the climatological OMI-based LERs with geometry-dependent LERs can increase NO2 vertical columns by up to 50 % in highly polluted areas; the differences include both BRDF effects and biases between the MODIS and OMI-based surface reflectance data sets. Only minor changes to NO2 columns (within 5 %) are found over unpolluted and overcast areas.},

In the laboratory, we determine the rate of this process at room temperature for a model system, 3-pentanone. We employ ab initio calculations to investigate H-shifts within a broader group of substituted organic compounds. We show that the rate of abstraction of hydrogen by peroxy radicals is largely determined by the thermochemistry of the nascent alkyl radicals and thus is highly influenced by neighboring substituents. As a result, autoxidation rates increase rapidly as oxygen-containing functional groups (carbonyl, hydroxy, and hydroperoxy) are added to organic compounds. This mechanism is consistent with formation of the multifunctional hydroperoxides and carbonyls often found in atmospheric aerosol particles.},

abstract = {Photolysis is shown to be a major sink for isoprene-derived carbonyl nitrates, which constitute an im-portant component of the total organic nitrate pool over veg-etated areas. Empirical evidence from published laboratory studies on the absorption cross sections and photolysis rates of $\alpha$-nitrooxy ketones suggests that the presence of the ni-trate group (i) greatly enhances the absorption cross sections and (ii) facilitates dissociation to a point that the photolysis quantum yield is close to unity, with O–NO 2 dissociation as a likely major channel. On this basis, we provide new recom-mendations for estimating the cross sections and photolysis rates of carbonyl nitrates. The newly estimated photo rates are validated using a chemical box model against measured temporal profiles of carbonyl nitrates in an isoprene oxida-tion experiment by Paulot et al. (2009). The comparisons for ethanal nitrate and for the sum of methacrolein-and methyl vinyl ketone nitrates strongly supports our assumptions of large cross-section enhancements and a near-unit quantum yield for these compounds. These findings have significant atmospheric implications: the photorates of key carbonyl ni-trates from isoprene are estimated to be typically between ∼ 3 and 20 times higher than their sink due to reaction with OH in relevant atmospheric conditions. Moreover, since the reaction is expected to release NO 2 , photolysis is especially effective in depleting the total organic nitrate pool.},

abstract = {The retrieval of atmospheric constituents from measurements of backscattered light requires a radiative transfer forward model that can simulate both intensities and weighting functions (partial derivatives of intensity with respect to atmospheric parameters being retrieved). The radiative transfer equation is solved in a multi-layer multiply-scattering atmosphere using the discrete ordinate method. In an earlier paper dealing with the upwelling top-of-the-atmosphere radiation field, it was shown that a full internal perturbation analysis of the plane-parallel discrete ordinate solution leads in a natural way to the simultaneous generation of analytically-derived weighting functions with respect to a wide range of atmospheric variables. In the present paper, a more direct approach is used to evaluate explicity all partial derivatives of the intensity field. A generalization of the post-processing function is developed for the derivation of weighting functions at arbitrary optical depth and stream angles for both upwelling and downwelling directions. Further, a complete treatment is given for the pseudo-spherical approximation of the direct beam attenuation; this is an important extension to the range of viewing geometries encountered in practical radiative transfer applications. The numerical model LIDORT developed for this work is able to generate intensities and weighting functions for a wide range of retrieval scenarios, in addition to the passive remote sensing application from space. We present a number of examples in an atmosphere with O3 absorption in the UV, for satellite (upwelling radiation) and ground-based (downwelling radiation) applications. In particular, we examine the effect of various pseudo-spherical parameterizations on backscatter intensities and weighting functions with respect to O3 volume mixing ratio. In addition, the use of layer-integrated multiple scatter output from the model is shown to be important for satellite instruments with wide-angle off-nadir viewing geometries.

Data from this campaign provided an opportunity to examine and improve our understanding of atmospheric photochemical oxidation processes related to the formation of secondary air pollutants such as ozone (O3). O3 production and its sensitivity to NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were calculated at different locations and times of day. Ozone production efficiency (OPE), defined as the ratio of the ozone production rate to the NOx oxidation rate, was calculated using the observations and the simulation results of the box and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. Correlations of these results with other parameters, such as radical sources and NOx mixing ratio, were also evaluated. It was generally found that O3 production tends to be more VOC-sensitive in the morning along with high ozone production rates, suggesting that control of VOCs may be an effective way to control O3 in Houston. In the afternoon, O3 production was found to be mainly NOx-sensitive with some exceptions. O3 production near major emissions sources such as Deer Park was mostly VOC-sensitive for the entire day, other urban areas near Moody Tower and Channelview were VOC-sensitive or in the transition regime, and areas farther from downtown Houston such as Smith Point and Conroe were mostly NOx-sensitive for the entire day. It was also found that the control of NOx emissions has reduced O3 concentrations over Houston but has led to larger OPE values. The results from this work strengthen our understanding of O3 production; they indicate that controlling NOx emissions will provide air quality benefits over the greater Houston metropolitan area in the long run, but in selected areas controlling VOC emissions will also be beneficial.},

abstract = {A new version of the BVOC emission scheme has been developed in the global vegetation model ORCHIDEE (Organizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEm), including an extended list of biogenic emitted compounds, updated emission factors (EFs), a dependency on light for almost all compounds and a multi-layer radiation scheme. For the 2000–2009 period, we estimate with this model, mean global emissions of 465 Tg C yr-1 for isoprene, 107.5 Tg C yr-1 for monoterpenes, 38 Tg C yr-1 for methanol, 25 Tg C yr-1 for acetone and 24 Tg C yr-1 for sesquiterpenes. The model results are compared to state-of-the-art emission budgets, showing that the ORCHIDEE emissions are within the range of published estimates. ORCHIDEE BVOC emissions are compared to the estimates of the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN), largely used throughout the biogenic emissions and atmospheric chemistry community. Our results show that global emission budgets are, in general, in good agreement between the two models. ORCHIDEE emissions are 8 % higher for isoprene, 8 % lower for methanol, 17 % higher for acetone, 18 % higher for monoterpenes and 39 % higher for sesquiterpenes compared to MEGAN estimates. At the regional scale, the largest differences between ORCHIDEE and MEGAN are highlighted for isoprene in northern temperate regions, with the ORCHIDEE emissions being higher by 21 Tg C yr-1, and for monoterpenes being higher by 10 and 18 Tg C yr-1 in northern and southern tropical regions compared to MEGAN. The geographical differences, between the two models, are mainly associated with different EF and PFT distribution, while differences in the seasonal cycle are mostly driven by differences in the Leaf Area Index (LAI). Sensitivity tests are carried out for both models to explore the response to key variables or parameters such as LAI and Light Dependent Fraction (LDF). The ORCHIDEE and MEGAN emissions are differently affected by LAI changes, with a response highly sensitive to the considered compound. When the LAI is scaled by a factor of 0.5 (1.5), the global emission change is −21 % (+8 %) for ORCHIDEE and −15 % (+7 %) for MEGAN regarding isoprene, and is −43 % (+40 %) for ORCHIDEE and −11 % (+3 %) for MEGAN regarding monoterpenes. We find that MEGAN is more sensitive to variation of LDF parameter than ORCHIDEE. Our results highlight the importance and the need to further explore the BVOC emission estimate variability and the interest of using models to investigate the estimate uncertainties.},

abstract = {Evidence suggests deep stratospheric intrusions can elevate western US surface ozone to unhealthy levels during spring. These intrusions can be classified as 'exceptional events', which are not counted towards non-attainment determinations. Understanding the factors driving the year-to-year variability of these intrusions is thus relevant for effective implementation of the US ozone air quality standard. Here we use observations and model simulations to link these events to modes of climate variability. We show more frequent late spring stratospheric intrusions when the polar jet meanders towards the western United States, such as occurs following strong La Ni{\~{n}}a winters (Ni{\~{n}}o3.4<-1.0 °C). While El Ni{\~{n}}o leads to enhancements of upper tropospheric ozone, we find this influence does not reach surface air. Fewer and weaker intrusion events follow in the two springs after the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. The linkage between La Ni{\~{n}}a and western US stratospheric intrusions can be exploited to provide a few months of lead time during which preparations could be made to deploy targeted measurements aimed at identifying these exceptional events.},

abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), particulate matter composed of compounds formed from the atmospheric transformation of organic species, accounts for a substantial fraction of tropospheric aerosol. The formation of low-volatility (semivolatile and possibly nonvolatile) compounds that make up SOA is governed by a complex series of reactions of a large number of organic species, so the experimental characterization and theoretical description of SOA formation presents a substantial challenge. In this review we outline what is known about the chemistry of formation and continuing transformation of low-volatility species in the atmosphere. The primary focus is chemical processes that can change the volatility of organic compounds: (1) oxidation reactions in the gas phase, (2) reactions in the particle phase, and (3) continuing chemistry (in either phase) over several generations. Gas-phase oxidation reactions can reduce volatility by the addition of polar functional groups or increase it by the cleavage of carbon–carbon bonds; key branch points that control volatility are the initial attack of the oxidant, reactions of alkylperoxy (RO2) radicals, and reactions of alkoxy (RO) radicals. Reactions in the particle phase include oxidation reactions as well as accretion reactions, non-oxidative processes leading to the formation of high-molecular-weight species. Organic carbon in the atmosphere is continually subject to reactions in the gas and particle phases throughout its atmospheric lifetime (until lost by physical deposition or oxidized to CO or CO2), implying continual changes in volatility over the timescales of several days. The volatility changes arising from these chemical reactions must be parameterized and included in models in order to gain a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation.},

abstract = {Tropopause folds are intimately linked to upper level frontogenesis and jet stream dynamics. They play an important role for stratosphere-troposphere exchange, the dynamical coupling of upper and lower tropospheric levels, and for generating severe weather events. This study presents a global climatology of tropopause folds using ERA-Interim reanalysis data from 1979 to 2012 and a refined version of a previously developed 3-D labeling and fold identification algorithm. This algorithm objectively separates stratospheric and tropospheric air in complex situations, e.g., in regions with strong low-level inversions, and in extratropical cyclones where diabatically generated potential vorticity anomalies typically occur. Three classes of tropopause folds are defined (shallow, medium, and deep), and their geographical distribution, vertical extent, and seasonal cycle are investigated. Most shallow folds occur along the subtropical jet stream, in agreement with previous studies. Hot spots of medium and deep tropopause folds are found west of Australia and along the coast of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere and around the east coast of North America in the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal cycles show maxima in winter for all fold classes. Medium and deep folds are frequently associated with surface wind gust and precipitation extremes, as quantified for folds over the southern Indian Ocean. Wind gust extremes occur mainly in an elongated band upstream and equatorward of folds, whereas precipitation extremes occur mainly east and poleward of folds. Overall, in the considered region, about 20% of medium folds and 33% of deep folds are associated with surface wind or precipitation extremes in the vicinity of the fold.},

abstract = {Recently it was discovered that over the Middle East during summer ozone mixing ratios can reach a pronounced maximum in the middle troposphere. Here we extend the analysis to the surface and show that especially in the Persian Gulf region conditions are highly favorable for ozone air pollution. We apply the EMAC atmospheric chemistry-climate model to investigate long-distance transport and the regional formation of ozone. Further, we make use of available in situ and satellite measurements and compare these with model output. The results indicate that the region is a hot spot of photochemical smog where European Union air quality standards are violated throughout the year. Long-distance transports of air pollution from Europe and the Middle East, natural emissions and stratospheric ozone conspire to bring about relatively high background ozone mixing ratios. This provides a hotbed to strong and growing indigenous air pollution in the dry local climate, and these conditions are likely to get worse in the future.},

abstract = {We present a physiological model of isoprene (2-methyl-3-butadiene) Emission which considers the cost for isoprene synthesis, and the production of reductive equivalents in reactions of photosynthetic electron transport for Liquidambar styraciflua L, and for North American and European deciduous temperate Quercus species, In the model,,ve differentiate between leaf morphology (leaf dry mass per area, M-A, g m(-2)) altering the content of enzymes of isoprene synthesis pathway per unit leaf area, and biochemical potentials of average leaf cells determining their capacity for isoprene emission. Isoprene emission rate per unit leaf area (mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) is calculated as the product of MA, the fraction of total electron flow used for isoprene synthesis (epsilon, mol mol(-1)), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J) per unit leaf dry mass (J(m), mu mol g(-1) s(-1)), and the reciprocal of the electron cost of isoprene synthesis mol isoprene (mol electrons(-1)), The initial estimate of electron cost of isoprene synthesis is calculated according to the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway recently discovered in the chloroplasts, and is further modified to account for extra electron requirements because of photorespiration, The rate of photosynthetic electron transport is calculated by a process-based leaf photosynthesis model. A satisfactory fit to the light-dependence of isoprene emission is obtained using the light response curve of J, and a single value of epsilon, that is dependent on the isoprene synthase activity in the leaves. Temperature dependence of isoprene emission is obtained by combining the temperature response curves of photosynthetic electron transport, the shape of which is related to long-term temperature during leaf growth and development, and the specific activity of isoprene synthase, which is considered as essentially constant for all plants. The results of simulations demonstrate that the variety of temperature responses of isoprene emission observed within and among the species in previous studies mag be explained by different optimum temperatures of J and/or limited maximum fraction of electrons used for isoprene synthesis, The model provides good fits to diurnal courses of field measurements of isoprene emission, and is also able to describe the changes in isoprene emission under stress conditions, for example, the decline in isoprene emission in water-stressed leaves.},

abstract = {The magnitudes, distributions, controlling processes and uncertainties associated with North American natural emissions of oxidant precursors are reviewed. Natural emissions are responsible for a major portion of the compounds, including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), that determine tropospheric oxidant concentrations. Natural sources include soil microbes, vegetation, biomass burning, and lightning. These sources are strongly influenced by human activities that have led to significant changes in the magnitude and distribution of natural emissions in the past two centuries. The total NMVOC flux of about 84x1012g of carbon (Tg C) is comprised primarily of isoprene (35%), 19 other terpenoid compounds (25%) and 17 non-terpenoid compounds (40%). Vegetation is predicted to contribute about 98% of the total annual natural NMVOC emission. The estimated annual natural NO emission of 2.1x1012g of nitrogen (Tg N) from North America is primarily due to soils and lightning, while the estimated 10Tg C of CO arises from biomass burning and vegetation. Field measurements of ambient concentrations and above canopy fluxes have validated emission estimates for a few compounds from some important landscapes. The uncertainty associated with natural emission estimates ranges from less than 50% for midday summer isoprene emission from some locations to about a factor of 10 for some compounds and landscapes.

abstract = {We describe a nearly explicit chemical mechanism for isoprene photooxidation guided by chamber studies that include time-resolved observation of an extensive suite of volatile compounds. We provide new constraints on the chemistry of the poorly-understood isoprene delta-hydroxy channels, which account for more than one third of the total isoprene carbon flux and a larger fraction of the nitrate yields. We show that the cis branch dominates the chemistry of the delta-hydroxy channel with less than 5% of the carbon following the trans branch. The modelled yield of isoprene nitrates is 12 3% with a large difference between the delta and beta branches. The oxidation of these nitrates releases about 50% of the NOx. Methacrolein nitrates (modelled yield similar or equal to 15 3% from methacrolein) and methylvinylketone nitrates (modelled yield similar or equal to 11 3% yield from methylvinylketone) are also observed. Propanone nitrate, produced with a yield of 1% from isoprene, appears to be the longest-lived nitrate formed in the total oxidation of isoprene. We find a large molar yield of formic acid and suggest a novel mechanism leading to its formation from the organic nitrates. Finally, the most important features of this mechanism are summarized in a condensed scheme appropriate for use in global chemical transport models.},

This data set, developed under the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate project (MACC), is called MEGAN-MACC. The model estimated mean annual total BVOC emission of 760 Tg (C) yr(-1) consisting of isoprene (70 %), monoterpenes (11 %), methanol (6 %), acetone (3 %), sesquiterpenes (2.5 %) and other BVOC species each contributing less than 2 %. Several sensitivity model runs were performed to study the impact of different model input and model settings on isoprene estimates and resulted in differences of up to +/-17% of the reference isoprene total. A greater impact was observed for a sensitivity run applying parameterization of soil moisture deficit that led to a 50% reduction of isoprene emissions on a global scale, most significantly in specific regions of Africa, South America and Australia. MEGAN-MACC estimates are comparable to results of previous studies. More detailed comparison with other isoprene inventories indicated significant spatial and temporal differences between the data sets especially for Australia, Southeast Asia and South America. MEGAN-MACC estimates of isoprene, alpha-pinene and group of monoterpenes showed a reasonable agreement with surface flux measurements at sites located in tropical forests in the Amazon and Malaysia. The model was able to capture the seasonal variation of isoprene emissions in the Amazon forest.},

abstract = {This paper presents our new formaldehyde (H2CO) retrievals, obtained from spectra recorded by the nadir instrument of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) flown on-board NASA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SUOMI-NPP) satellite. Our algorithm is similar to the one currently in place for the production of NASA's Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) operational H2CO product. We are now able to produce a consistent set of long term data from two different instruments that share a similar concept. The ongoing overlap period between OMI and OMPS offers a perfect opportunity to study the consistency between both data sets. The different spatial and spectral resolution of the instruments is a source of discrepancy in the retrievals despite the similarity of the physic assumptions of the algorithm. We have concluded that the reduced spectral resolution of OMPS in comparison with OMI is not a significant obstacle in obtaining good quality retrievals. Indeed, the improved signal to noise ratio (SNR) of OMPS with respect to OMI helps to reduce the noise of the retrievals performed using OMPS spectra. However, the size of OMPS spatial pixels imposes a limitation in the capability to distinguish particular features of H2CO that are discernible with OMI. With root mean square (RMS) residuals $\sim$ 5 × 10−4 for individual pixels we estimate the detection limit to be about 7.5 × 1015 molecules cm−2. Total vertical column densities (VCD) errors for individual pixels range between 40 % for pixels with high concentrations to 100 % or more for pixels with concentrations at or below the detection limit. We compare different OMI products with our OMPS product using one year of data, between September 2012 and September 2013. The seasonality of the retrieved slant columns is captured similarly by all products but there are discrepancies in the values of the VCDs. The mean biases among the two OMI products and our OMPS product are 21 % between OMI SAO and OMPS SAO and 38 % between OMI BIRA and OMPS SAO for eight selected regions.},

abstract = {Reunion Island (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E), situated in the Indian Ocean at about 800 km east of Madagascar, is appropriately located to monitor the outflow of biomass burning pollution from Southern Africa and Madagascar, in the case of short-lived compounds, and from other Southern Hemispheric landmasses such as South America, in the case of longer-lived species. Ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar absorption observations are sensitive to a large number of biomass burning products. We present in this work the FTIR retrieval strategies, suitable for very humid sites such as Reunion Island, for hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), methanol (CH3OH), and formic acid (HCOOH). We provide their total columns time-series obtained from the measurements during August-October 2004, May-October 2007, and May 2009-December 2010. We show that biomass burning explains a large part of the observed seasonal and interannual variability of the chemical species. The correlations between the daily mean total columns of each of the species and those of CO, also measured with our FTIR spectrometer at Reunion Island, are very good from August to November (R >= 0.86). This allows us to derive, for that period, the following enhancement ratios with respect to CO: 0.0047, 0.0078, 0.0020, 0.012, and 0.0046 for HCN, C2H6, C2H2, CH3OH, and HCOOH, respectively. The HCN ground-based data are compared to the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, while the data for the other species are compared to the IMAGESv2 model. We show that using the HCN/CO ratio derived from our measurements (0.0047) in GEOS-Chem reduces the underestimation of the modeled HCN columns compared with the FTIR measurements. The comparisons between IMAGESv2 and the long-lived species C2H6 and C2H2 indicate that the biomass burning emissions used in the model (from the GFED3 inventory) are probably underestimated in the late September-October period for all years of measurements, and especially in 2004. The comparisons with the short-lived species, CH3OH and HCOOH, with lifetimes of around 5 days, suggest that the emission underestimation in late September-October 2004, occurs more specifically in the Southeastern Africa-Madagascar region. The very good correlation of CH3OH and HCOOH with CO suggests that, despite the dominance of the biogenic source of these compounds on the global scale, biomass burning is their major source at Reunion Island between August and November.},

We produced the full data set by combining 500 m MODIS burned area maps with active fire data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) family of sensors.

We assessed the interannual variability and trends in burned area on the basis of a region-specific definition of fire years. With respect to trends, we found a gradual decrease of 1.7Mhayr − 1 ( − 1.4%yr − 1) in Northern Hemisphere Africa since 2000, a gradual increase of 2.3Mhayr − 1 (+1.8%yr − 1) in Southern Hemisphere Africa also since 2000, a slight increase of 0.2Mhayr − 1 (+2.5%yr − 1) in Southeast Asia since 1997, and a rapid decrease of approximately 5.5Mhayr − 1 ( − 10.7%yr − 1) from 2001 through 2011 in Australia, followed by a major upsurge in 2011 that exceeded the annual area burned in at least the previous 14 years.

abstract = {Isoprene is the largest single VOC emission to the atmosphere. Although it is primarily oxidized photochemically during daylight hours, late-day emissions that remain in the atmosphere at sunset undergo oxidation by NO3 in regionally polluted areas with large NOx levels. A recent aircraft study examined isoprene and its nocturnal oxidants in a series of night flights across the Northeast US, a region with large emissions of both isoprene and NOx. Substantial amounts of isoprene that were observed after dark were strongly anticorrelated with measured NO3 and were the most important factor determining the lifetime of this radical. The products of photochemical oxidation of isoprene, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, were more uniformly distributed, and served as tracers for the presence of isoprene at sunset, prior to its oxidation by NO3. A determination of the mass of isoprene oxidized in darkness showed it to be a large fraction (>20%) of emitted isoprene. Organic nitrates produced from the NO3+isoprene reaction, though not directly measured, were estimated to account for 2-9% of total reactive nitrogen. The mass of isoprene oxidized by NO3 was comparable to and correlated with the organic aerosol loading for flights with relatively low organic aerosol background. The contribution of nocturnal isoprene oxidation to secondary organic aerosol was determined in the range 1 17%, and isoprene SOA mass derived from NO3 was calculated to exceed that due to OH by approximately 50%.},

abstract = {Due to the scarcity of observational constraints and the rapidly changing environment in East and Southeast Asia, isoprene emissions predicted by models are expected to bear substantial uncertainties. The aim of this study is to improve upon the existing bottom-up estimates, and to investigate the temporal evolution of the fluxes in Asia over 1979-2012. To this purpose, we calculate the hourly emissions at 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution using the MEGAN-MOHYCAN model driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim climatology. In order to remedy for known biases identified in previous studies, and to improve the simulation of interannual variability and trends in emissions, this study incorporates (i) changes in land use, including the rapid expansion of oil palms, (ii) meteorological variability according to ERA-Interim, (iii) long-term changes in solar radiation (dimming/brightening) constrained by surface network radiation measurements, and (iv) recent experimental evidence that South Asian tropical forests are much weaker isoprene emitters than previously assumed, and on the other hand, that oil palms have a strong isoprene emission capacity. These effects lead to a significant lowering (factor of 2) in the total isoprene fluxes over the studied domain, and to emission reductions reaching a factor of 3.5 in Southeast Asia. The bottom-up annual isoprene emissions for 2005 are estimated at 7.0, 4.8, 8.3, and 2.9 Tg in China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, respectively. The isoprene flux anomaly over the whole domain and studied period is found to be strongly correlated with the Oceanic Nino Index (r = 0.73), with positive (negative) anomalies related to El Nino (La Nina) years. Changes in temperature and solar radiation are the major drivers of the interannual variability and trends in the emissions, except over semi-arid areas such as northwestern China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, where soil moisture is by far the main cause of interannual emission changes. In our base simulation, annual positive flux trends of 0.2% and 0.52% throughout the entire period are found in Asia and China, respectively, related to a positive trend in temperature and solar radiation. The impact of oil palm expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia is to enhance the trends over that region, e. g., from 1.17% to 1.5% in 1979-2005 in Malaysia. A negative emission trend is derived in India (-0.4 %), owing to the negative trend in solar radiation data associated with the strong dimming effect likely due to increasing aerosol loadings. The bottom-up emissions are compared to field campaign measurements in Borneo and South China and further evaluated against top-down isoprene emission estimates constrained by GOME-2/MetOp-A formaldehyde columns through 2007-2012. The satellite-based estimates appear to support our assumptions, and confirm the lower emission rate in tropical forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. Additional flux measurements are clearly needed to characterize the spatial variability of emission factors better. Finally, a decreasing trend in the inferred top-down Chinese emissions since 2007},

abstract = {In this study, mixing ratios of NO2 (XNO2) and HCHO (XHCHO) in the free troposphere are derived from two Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) data sets collected at Zugspitze (2650 m a.s.l., Germany) and Pico Espejo (4765 m a.s.l., Venezuela). The estimation of NO2 and HCHO mixing ratios is based on the modified geometrical approach, which assumes a single-scattering geometry and a scattering point altitude close to the instrument. Firstly, the horizontal optical path length (hOPL) is obtained from O4 differential slant column densities (DSCDs) in the horizontal (0 degrees) and vertical (90 degrees) viewing directions. Secondly, XNO2 and XHCHO are estimated from the NO2 and HCHO DSCDs at the 0 and 90 degree viewing directions and averaged along the obtained hOPLs. As the MAX-DOAS instrument was performing measurements in the ultraviolet region, wavelength ranges of 346-372 and 338-357 nm are selected for the DOAS analysis to retrieve NO2 and HCHO DSCDs, respectively. In order to compare the measured O4 DSCDs and moreover to perform some sensitivity tests, the radiative transfer model SCIATRAN with adapted altitude settings for mountainous terrain is operated to simulate synthetic spectra, on which the DOAS analysis is also applied. The overall agreement between measured and synthetic O4 DSCDs is better for the higher Pico Espejo station than for Zugspitze. Further sensitivity analysis shows that a change in surface albedo (from 0.05 to 0.7) can influence the O4 DSCDs, with a larger absolute difference observed for the horizontal viewing direction. Consequently, the hOPL can vary by about 5 % throughout the season, for example when winter snow cover fully disappears in summer. Typical values of hOPLs during clear sky conditions are 19 km (14 km) at Zugspitze and 34 km (26.5 km) at Pico Espejo when using the 346-372 nm (338-357 nm) fitting window. The estimated monthly values of XNO2 (XHCHO), averaged over these hOPLs during clear sky conditions, are in the range of 60-100 ppt (500-950 ppt) at Zugspitze and 8.5-15.5 ppt (255-385 ppt) at Pico Espejo. Interestingly, multi-year averaged monthly means of XNO2 and XHCHO increase towards the end of the dry season at the Pico Espejo site, suggesting that both trace gases are frequently lifted above the boundary layer as a result of South American biomass burning.},

abstract = {Quantifying isoprene emissions using satellite observations of the formaldehyde (HCHO) columns is subject to errors involving the column retrieval and the assumed relationship between HCHO columns and isoprene emissions, taken here from the GEOS-CHEM chemical transport model. Here we use a 6-year (1996–2001) HCHO column data set from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite instrument to (1) quantify these errors, (2) evaluate GOME-derived isoprene emissions with in situ flux measurements and a process-based emission inventory (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, MEGAN), and (3) investigate the factors driving the seasonal and interannual variability of North American isoprene emissions. The error in the GOME HCHO column retrieval is estimated to be 40%. We use the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) to quantify the time-dependent HCHO production from isoprene, $\alpha$- and $\beta$-pinenes, and methylbutenol and show that only emissions of isoprene are detectable by GOME. The time-dependent HCHO yield from isoprene oxidation calculated by MCM is 20–30% larger than in GEOS-CHEM. GOME-derived isoprene fluxes track the observed seasonal variation of in situ measurements at a Michigan forest site with a −30% bias. The seasonal variation of North American isoprene emissions during 2001 inferred from GOME is similar to MEGAN, with GOME emissions typically 25% higher (lower) at the beginning (end) of the growing season. GOME and MEGAN both show a maximum over the southeastern United States, but they differ in the precise location. The observed interannual variability of this maximum is 20–30%, depending on month. The MEGAN isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature explains 75% of the month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the southeastern United States during May–September 1996–2001.},

abstract = {Emission of non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere stems from biogenic and human activities, and their estimation is difficult because of the many and not fully understood processes involved. In order to narrow down the uncertainty related to VOC emissions, which negatively reflects on our ability to simulate the atmospheric composition, we exploit satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO), an ubiquitous oxidation product of most VOCs, focusing on Europe. HCHO column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) reveal a marked seasonal cycle with a summer maximum and winter minimum. In summer, the oxidation of methane and other long-lived VOCs supply a slowly varying background HCHO column, while HCHO variability is dominated by most reactive VOC, primarily biogenic isoprene followed in importance by biogenic terpenes and anthropogenic VOCs. The chemistry-transport model CHIMERE qualitatively reproduces the temporal and spatial features of the observed HCHO column, but display regional biases which are attributed mainly to incorrect biogenic VOC emissions, calculated with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosol from Nature (MEGAN) algorithm. These "bottom-up" or a-priori emissions are corrected through a Bayesian inversion of the OMI HCHO observations. Resulting "top-down" or a-posteriori isoprene emissions are lower than "bottom-up" by 40% over the Balkans and by 20% over Southern Germany, and higher by 20% over Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Italy. We conclude that OMI satellite observations of HCHO can provide a quantitative "top-down" constraint on the European "bottom-up" VOC inventories.},

abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO) column data from satellites are widely used as a proxy for emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but validation of the data has been extremely limited. Here we use highly accurate HCHO aircraft observations from the NASA SEAC4RS campaign over the Southeast US in August-September 2013 to validate and intercompare six operational and research retrievals of HCHO columns from four different satellite instruments (OMI, GOME2A, GOME2B and OMPS) and three different research groups. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model provides a common intercomparison platform. We find that all retrievals capture the HCHO maximum over Arkansas and Louisiana, reflecting high emissions of biogenic isoprene, and are consistent in their spatial variability over the Southeast US (r = 0.4-0.8 on a 0.5 by 0.5 grid) as well as their day-to-day variability (r = 0.5-0.8). However, all satellite retrievals are biased low in the mean by 20-51 %, which would lead to corresponding bias in estimates of isoprene emissions from the satellite data. The smallest bias is for OMI-BIRA, which has the highest corrected slant columns and the lowest scattering weights in its air mass factor (AMF) calculation. Correcting the assumed HCHO vertical profiles (shape factors) used in the AMF calculation would further reduce the bias in the OMI-BIRA data. We conclude that current satellite HCHO data provide a reliable proxy for isoprene emission variability but with a low mean bias due both to the corrected slant columns and the scattering weights used in the retrievals.},

abstract = {We implement a new isoprene oxidation mechanism in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). Model results are evaluated with observations for ozone, isoprene oxidation products, and related species from the International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation aircraft campaign over the eastern United States in summer 2004. The model achieves an unbiased simulation of ozone in the boundary layer and the free troposphere, reflecting canceling effects from recent model updates for isoprene chemistry, bromine chemistry, and HO2 loss to aerosols. Simulation of the ozone-CO correlation is improved relative to previous versions of the model, and this is attributed to a lower and reversible yield of isoprene nitrates, increasing the ozone production efficiency per unit of nitrogen oxides (NOx ≡ NO + NO2). The model successfully reproduces the observed concentrations of organic nitrates (∑ANs) and their correlations with HCHO and ozone. ∑ANs in the model is principally composed of secondary isoprene nitrates, including a major contribution from nighttime isoprene oxidation. The correlations of ∑ANs with HCHO and ozone then provide sensitive tests of isoprene chemistry and argue in particular against a fast isomerization channel for isoprene peroxy radicals. ∑ANs can provide an important reservoir for exporting NOx from the U.S. boundary layer. We find that the dependence of surface ozone on isoprene emission is positive throughout the U.S., even if NOx emissions are reduced by a factor of 4. Previous models showed negative dependences that we attribute to erroneous titration of OH by isoprene.},

abstract = {Only very few long-term trends of formaldehyde (HCHO) exist. Furthermore, many uncertainties remain as to its diurnal cycle, representing a large short-term variability superimposed on seasonal and inter-annual variations that should be accounted for when comparing ground-based observations to e.g., model results. In this study, we derive a multi-decadal time series (January 1988 - June 2015) of HCHO total columns from ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar spectra recorded at the high-altitude station of Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps, 46.5° N, 8.0° E, 3580 m a.s.l.), allowing for the characterization of the mid-latitudinal atmosphere for background conditions. First we investigate the HCHO diurnal variation, peaking around noontime and mainly driven by the intra-day insolation modulation and methane (CH4) oxidation. We also characterize quantitatively the diurnal cycles by adjusting a parametric model to the observations, which links the daytime to the HCHO columns according to the monthly intra-day regimes. It is then employed to scale all the individual FTIR measurements on a given daytime in order to remove the effect of the intra-day modulation for improving the trend determination and the comparison with HCHO columns simulated by the state-of-the-art chemical transport model GEOS-Chem v9-02. Such a parametric model will be useful to scale the Jungfraujoch HCHO columns on satellite overpass times in the framework of future calibration/validation efforts of space borne sensors. GEOS-Chem sensitivity tests suggest then that the seasonal and inter-annual HCHO column variations above Jungfraujoch are predominantly led by the atmospheric CH4 oxidation, with a maximum contribution of 25 % from the anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compound precursors during wintertime. Finally, trend analysis of the so-scaled 27 year FTIR time series reveals a long-term evolution of the HCHO columns in the remote troposphere to be related with the atmospheric CH4 fluctuations and the short-term OH variability: +2.9 % per yr between 1988 and 1995, -3.7 % per yr over 1996-2002 and +0.8 % per yr from 2003 onwards.},

abstract = {On the basis of a data set collected during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) campaign 1999, we investigated the formaldehyde (CH2O) budget in the southern Indian Ocean (SIO). With a photochemical box model we simulated the contribution of methane and nonmethane volatile organic compounds to the CH2O budget. To identify the reactions and model constraints that introduce the largest uncertainties in the modeled CH2O concentration, we carried out a local sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo method was used to assess the global error of the model predictions. According to this analysis the 2 uncertainty in the modeled CH2O concentration is 49%. The deviation between observed (200 +/- 70 parts per trillion by volume (pptv) (2sigma)) and modeled (224 +/- 110 pptv (2sigma)) daily mean CH2O concentration is 12%. However, the combined errors of model and measurement are such that deviations as large as 65% are not significant at the 2 level. Beyond the "standard'' photochemistry we analyzed the impact of halogen and aerosol chemistry on the CH2O concentration and investigated the vertical distribution of CH2O in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Calculations with the Model of Chemistry Considering Aerosols indicate that, based on the current understanding, halogen chemistry and aerosol chemistry have no significant impact on the CH2O concentration under conditions encountered in the SIO. However, a detailed investigation including meteorological effects such as precipitation scavenging and convection reveals an uncertainty in state-of- the-art model predictions for CH2O in the MBL that is too large for a meaningful test of the current understanding of CH4 photooxidation.},

abstract = {We present a largely tutorial overview of the main processes that influence the photochemistry of the background troposphere. This is mostly driven by the photolysis of ozone by solar ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than about 340 nm, resulting in production of excited O(1D) atoms, whose reaction with water vapor produces OH radicals. In the background atmosphere the OH radicals mostly react with CO, and with CH4 and some of its oxidation products, which in turn are oxidized by OH. Depending on the availability of NOx catalysts, ozone may be produced or destroyed in amounts that are much greater than the downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere. Using the 3D chemical-transport model MATCH, global distributions and budget analyses are presented for tropospheric O3, CH4, CO, and the “odd hydrogen” compounds OH, HO2 and H2O2. We show that OH is present in maximum concentrations in the tropics, and that most of the chemical breakdown of CO and CH4 also occurs in equatorial regions. We also split the troposphere into continental and marine regions, and show that there is a tremendous difference in photochemical O3 and OH production for these regions, much larger than the difference between the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere. Finally, we show the results from a numerical simulation in which we reduced the amount of ozone in the model stratosphere by a factor of 10 (which in turn reduced the flux of O3 into the troposphere by about the same factor). Nevertheless, for summer conditions, model calculated O3 mixing ratios below 5 km in the mid to high latitudes were about 70–90% as high as those calculated with the full downward flux of ozone from the stratosphere. This indicates that, at least under these conditions, O3 concentrations in the lower troposphere are largely controlled by in situ photochemistry, with only a secondary influence from stratospheric influx.},

The FTIR and MAX-DOAS daily mean formaldehyde total columns are intercompared in their common measurement period, from August to October 2004. The ground-based data are also compared to correlative SCIAMACHY data. The comparisons account for the vertical sensitivity differences of the data sets, by including their respective averaging kernels. Complete error budgets are also presented. The FTIR and MAX-DOAS daily mean total columns agree very well: no significant bias is observed and the standard deviation of the comparisons is only 8%. Both FTIR and MAX-DOAS HCHO total columns are in good agreement with SCIAMACHY values in the 2004-2005 period, with standard deviations of 21% and 31%, respectively. The same seasonal cycle is observed by the different instruments, with a minimum in austral winter and a maximum in February-March. The FTIR and MAX-DOAS data are confronted with HCHO columns calculated by a global CTM, the IMAGES model. The model underestimates the HCHO columns by 23-29% in comparison with FTIR, and by 15% in comparison with DOAS. This bias might have multiple causes, including an underestimation of OH concentrations in the model (as indicated by a sensitivity study using prescribed OH fields) and/or an underestimated contribution of large-scale transport of HCHO precursors from Madagascar. The latter hypothesis is comforted by the large observed day-to-day variability of HCHO columns, and by the observation that the peak values of FTIR columns can often be associated with free tropospheric transport patterns from source regions over Madagascar to R,union Island, according to simulations performed with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART.},

abstract = {We present a new dataset of formaldehyde vertical columns retrieved from observations of GOME-2 on board the EUMETSAT MetOp-A platform between 2007 and 2011. The new retrieval scheme, which has been optimised for GOME-2, includes a two-step fitting procedure that strongly reduces the impact of spectral interferences between H2CO and BrO, and a modified DOAS approach that better handles ozone absorption effects at moderately low sun elevations. Owing to these new features, the noise in the H2CO slant columns is reduced by up to 40% in comparison to baseline retrieval settings used operationally. Also, the previously reported underestimation of the H2CO columns in tropical and mid-latitude regions has been largely eliminated, improving the agreement with coincident SCIAMACHY observations. To compensate for the drift of the GOME-2 slit function and to mitigate the instrumental degradation effects on H2CO retrievals, an asymmetric Gaussian line-shape is fitted during the irradiance calibration. Additionally, external parameters used in the tropospheric air mass factor computation (surface reflectances, cloud parameters and a priori profile shapes of H2CO) have been updated using most recent databases. Similar updates were also applied to the historical datasets of GOME and SCIAMACHY, leading to the generation of a consistent multi-mission H2CO data record covering the time period from 1997 until 2011. Comparing the resulting time series of monthly averaged H2CO vertical columns in 12 large regions worldwide, the correlation coefficient between SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 columns is generally higher than 0.8 in the overlap period, and linear regression slopes differ by less than 10% from unity in most of the regions. In comparison to SCIAMACHY, the largely improved spatial sampling of GOME-2 allows for a better characterisation of formaldehyde distribution at the regional scale and/or at shorter timescales, leading to a better identification of the emission sources of non-methane volatile organic compounds.},

abstract = {We characterize the temporal variation and spatial distribution of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (HCHO) and aerosol extinctions using vertical profiles derived from long-term Multi Axis – Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations from May 2011 to November 2014 in Wuxi, China. A new inversion algorithm (PriAM) is implemented to retrieve profiles of the trace gases (TGs) and aerosol extinction (AE) from the UV spectra of scattered sunlight recorded by the MAX-DOAS instrument. We investigated two important aspects of the retrieval process. We found that the systematic seasonal variation of temperature and pressure (which is regularly observed in Wuxi) can lead to a systematic bias of the retrieved aerosol profiles (e.g. up 20 % for the AOD) if it is not explicitly considered. In this study we take this effect for the first time into account. We also investigated in detail the reason for the differences of tropospheric VCDs derived from either the geometric approximation or by the integration of the retrieved profiles, which were reported by earlier studies. We found that these differences are almost entirely caused by the limitations of the geometric approximation (especially for high aerosol loads). The results retrieved from the MAX-DOAS observations are compared with independent techniques not only under cloud free sky conditions, but also under various cloud scenarios. Under most cloudy conditions (except fog and optically thick clouds), the trace gas results still show good agreement. In contrast, from the aerosol results only near-surface AEs could be still well retrieved under cloudy situations. After a quality controlling procedure, the MAX-DOAS data are used to characterize the seasonal, diurnal, and weekly variations of NO2, SO2, HCHO and aerosols. A regular seasonality of the three trace gases is found, but not for aerosols. Similar diurnal variations are found for SO2, HCHO and aerosols in different seasons, but not for NO2. Similar annual variations of the profiles are found in different years, especially for the trace gases. Considerable amplitudes of weekly cycles occur for NO2 and SO2, but not for HCHO and aerosols. Good correlations between the TGs and aerosols are found, especially for HCHO in winter. Significant wind direction dependencies of the trace gases, especially for the near-surface concentrations, are found, but only a weak dependence is found for aerosol properties, especially the AOD. Our findings imply that the local emissions from the industrial area (including traffic emissions) dominate the amount of local pollutants while long distance transport might also considerably contribute to the local aerosol levels.},

abstract = {We describe a new global multiyear satellite fire product designed to meet the needs of the global modeling community. We use the new data set to analyze the global distribution of biomass burning using five different temporal metrics derived from 5 years of high-quality satellite data acquired with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), on board NASA's Terra satellite. The global distributions of fire pixel density, peak month, season length, and annual periodicity are described. As part of our analysis we show, for the first time, the global distribution of the fire radiative power (FRP), a relatively new remotely sensed quantity.We find that low FRP tends to be associated with areas of cropland burning. In the tropics and much of the subtropics, low FRP is also associated with more heavily forested areas, while higher FRP tends to occur in areas of grassland burning. In boreal forests this trend is reversed, with higher FRP occurring in areas of greater tree cover. We next combine 3 years of Terra and Aqua MODIS observations to show that a strong diurnal fire cycle is prevalent at tropical and subtropical latitudes. We also consider the consistency of the fire time series recorded by the two MODIS instruments, and find the month of peak burning and fire season length observed by each to be in good agreement in most areas. However, significant discrepancies with respect to seasonality do occur in some relatively small areas, and are most pronounced in tropical rain forest.},

abstract = {Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 654 S. Sitch et al.: Recent trends and drivers of regional sources Abstract. The land and ocean absorb on average just over half of the anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) every year. These CO 2 " sinks " are modulated by climate change and variability. Here we use a suite of nine dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and four ocean biogeo-chemical general circulation models (OBGCMs) to estimate trends driven by global and regional climate and atmospheric CO 2 in land and oceanic CO 2 exchanges with the atmo-sphere over the period 1990–2009, to attribute these trends to underlying processes in the models, and to quantify the uncertainty and level of inter-model agreement. The mod-els were forced with reconstructed climate fields and ob-served global atmospheric CO 2 ; land use and land cover changes are not included for the DGVMs. Over the pe-riod 1990–2009, the DGVMs simulate a mean global land carbon sink of −2.4 ± 0.7 Pg C yr −1 with a small signifi-cant trend of −0.06 ± 0.03 Pg C yr −2 (increasing sink). Over the more limited period 1990–2004, the ocean models sim-ulate a mean ocean sink of −2.2 ± 0.2 Pg C yr −1 with a trend in the net C uptake that is indistinguishable from zero (−0.01 ± 0.02 Pg C yr −2). The two ocean models that ex-tended the simulations until 2009 suggest a slightly stronger, but still small, trend of −0.02 ± 0.01 Pg C yr −2 . Trends from land and ocean models compare favourably to the land green-ness trends from remote sensing, atmospheric inversion re-sults, and the residual land sink required to close the global carbon budget. Trends in the land sink are driven by increas-ing net primary production (NPP), whose statistically sig-nificant trend of 0.22 ± 0.08 Pg C yr −2 exceeds a significant trend in heterotrophic respiration of 0.16 ± 0.05 Pg C yr −2 – primarily as a consequence of widespread CO 2 fertilisation of plant production. Most of the land-based trend in simu-lated net carbon uptake originates from natural ecosystems in the tropics (−0.04 ± 0.01 Pg C yr −2), with almost no trend over the northern land region, where recent warming and reduced rainfall offsets the positive impact of elevated at-mospheric CO 2 and changes in growing season length on carbon storage. The small uptake trend in the ocean mod-els emerges because climate variability and change, and in particular increasing sea surface temperatures, tend to coun-teract the trend in ocean uptake driven by the increase in at-mospheric CO 2 . Large uncertainty remains in the magnitude and sign of modelled carbon trends in several regions, as well as regarding the influence of land use and land cover changes on regional trends.},

abstract = {The terrestrial biosphere has experienced dramatic changes in recent decades. Estimates of historical trends in land carbon fluxes remain uncertain because long-term observations are limited on the global scale. Here, we use the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere (YIBs) model to estimate decadal trends in land carbon fluxes and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and to identify the key drivers for these changes during 1982-2011. Driven by hourly meteorology from WFDEI (WATCH forcing data methodology applied to ERA-Interim data), the model simulates an increasing trend of 297 Tg Ca-2 in gross primary productivity (GPP) and 185 Tg Ca-2 in the net primary productivity (NPP). CO2 fertilization is the main driver for the flux changes in forest ecosystems, while meteorology dominates the changes in grasslands and shrublands. Warming boosts summer GPP and NPP at high latitudes, while drought dampens carbon uptake in tropical regions. North of 30 degrees N, increasing temperatures induce a substantial extension of 0.22 day a(-1) for the growing season; however, this phenological change alone does not promote regional carbon uptake and BVOC emissions. Nevertheless, increases of leaf area index at peak season accounts for similar to 25% of the trends in GPP and isoprene emissions at the northern lands. The net land sink shows statistically insignificant increases of only 3 Tg Ca-2 globally because of simultaneous increases in soil respiration. Global BVOC emissions are calculated using two schemes. With the photosynthesis-dependent scheme, the model predicts increases of 0.4 Tg Ca-2 in isoprene emissions, which are mainly attributed to warming trends because CO2 fertilization and inhibition effects offset each other. Using the MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) scheme, the YIBs model simulates global reductions of 1.1 Tg Ca-2 in isoprene and 0.04 Tg Ca-2 in monoterpene emissions in response to the CO2 inhibition effects. Land use change shows limited impacts on global carbon fluxes and BVOC emissions, but there are regional contrasting impacts over Europe (afforestation) and China (deforestation).},

abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO) being a high-yield product in the oxidation of most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by fires, vegetation and anthropogenic activities, satellite observations of HCHO are well-suited to inform us on the spatial and temporal variability of the underlying VOC sources. The long-record of space-based HCHO column observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is used to infer emission flux estimates from pyrogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global scale over 2005–2013. This is realized through the method of source inverse modelling, which consists in the optimization of emissions in a chemistry-transport model (CTM) in order to minimize the discrepancy between the observed and modelled HCHO columns. The top-down fluxes are derived in the global CTM IMAGESv2 by an iterative minimization algorithm based on the full adjoint of IMAGESv2, starting from a priori emission estimates provided by the newly released GFED4s (Global Fire Emission Database, version 4s) inventory for fires, and by the MEGAN-MOHYCAN inventory for isoprene emissions. The top-down fluxes are compared to two independent inventories for fire (GFAS and FINNv1.5) and isoprene emissions (MEGAN-MACC and GUESS-ES). The inversion indicates a moderate decrease (ca. 20 %) of the average annual global fire and isoprene emissions, from 2028 TgC in the a priori to 1653 TgC for burnt biomass, and from 343 to 272 Tg for isoprene fluxes. Those estimates are acknowledged to depend on the accuracy of formaldehyde data, as well as on the assumed fire emission factors and the oxidation mechanisms leading to HCHO production. Strongly decreased top-down fire fluxes (30–50 %) are inferred in the peak fire season in Africa, and during years with strong a priori fluxes associated to forest fires in Amazonia (in 2005, 2007 and 2010), bushfires in Australia (in 2006 and 2011), and peat burning in Indonesia (in 2006 and 2009), whereas generally increased fluxes are suggested in Indochina and during the 2007 fires in Southern Europe. Moreover, changes in fire seasonal patterns are suggested, e.g. the seasonal amplitude is reduced over Southeast Asia. In Africa, the inversion indicates increased fluxes due to agricultural fires, and decreased maxima when natural fires are dominant. The top-down fire emissions are much better correlated with MODIS fire counts than the a priori inventory in regions with small and agricultural fires, indicating that the OMI-based inversion is well-suited to assess the associated emissions. Regarding biogenic sources, significant reductions of isoprene fluxes are inferred in tropical ecosystems (30–40 %), suggesting overestimated basal emission rates in those areas in the bottom-up inventory, whereas strongly positive isoprene emission updates are derived over semi-arid and desert areas, especially in Southern Africa and Australia. This finding suggests that the parameterization of the soil moisture stress used in MEGAN greatly exaggerates the flux reduction due to drought in those regions. The isoprene emission trends over 2005–2013 are often enhanced after optimization, with positive top-down trends in Siberia (4.2 %/yr) and Eastern Europe (3.9 %/yr), likely reflecting forest expansion and warming temperatures, and negative trends in Amazonia (−2.1 %/yr), South China (−1 %/yr), the United States (−3.7 %/yr), and Western Europe (−3.3 %/yr), which are generally corroborated by independent studies, yet their interpretation warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Increases in free-tropospheric (FT) ozone based on ozonesonde records from the early 1990s through 2008 over two subtropical stations, Irene (near Pretoria, South Africa) and R union (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E; similar to 2800 km NE of Irene in the Indian Ocean), have been reported. Over Irene a large increase in the urban-influenced boundary layer (BL, 1.5-4 km) was also observed during the 18-year period, equivalent to 30% decade(-1). Here we show that the Irene BL trend is at least partly due to a gradual change in the sonde launch times from early morning to the midday period. The FT ozone profiles over Irene in 1990-2007 are re-examined, filling in a 1995-1999 gap with ozone profiles taken during the Measurements of Ozone by Airbus In-service Aircraft (MOZAIC) project over nearby Johannesburg. A multivariate regression model that accounts for the annual ozone cycle, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and possible tropopause changes was applied to monthly averaged Irene data from 4 to 11 km and to 1992-2011 Reunion sonde data from 4 to 15 km. Statistically significant trends appear predominantly in the middle and upper troposphere (UT; 4-11 km over Irene, 4-15 km over R union) in winter (June-August), with increases similar to 1 ppbv yr(-1) over Irene and similar to 2 ppbv yr(-1) over R union. These changes are equivalent to similar to 25 and 35-45% decade(-1), respectively. Both stations also display smaller positive trends in summer, with a 45% decade(-1) ozone increase near the tropopause over R union in December. To explain the ozone increases, we investigated a time series of dynamical markers, e. g., potential vorticity (PV) at 330-350 K. PV affects UT ozone over Irene in November-December but displays little relationship with ozone over R union. A more likely reason for wintertime FT ozone increases over Irene and R union appears to be long-range transport of growing pollution in the Southern Hemisphere. The ozone increases are consistent with trajectory origins of air parcels sampled by the sondes and with recent NOx emissions trends estimated for Africa, South America and Madagascar. For R union trajectories also point to sources from the eastern Indian Ocean and Asia.},

abstract = {We present a first description and evaluation of GEOS-CHEM, a global three-dimensional (3-D) model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological observations from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Data Assimilation Office (DAO). The model is applied to a 1-year simulation of tropospheric ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon chemistry for 1994, and is evaluated with observations both for 1994 and for other years. It reproduces usually to within 10 ppb the concentrations of ozone observed from the worldwide ozonesonde data network. It simulates correctly the seasonal phases and amplitudes of ozone concentrations for different regions and altitudes, but tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude at northern midlatitudes. Observed concentrations of NO and peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN) observed in aircraft campaigns are generally reproduced to within a factor of 2 and often much better. Concentrations of HNO3 in the remote troposphere are overestimated typically by a factor of 2-3, a common problem in global models that may reflect a combination of insufficient precipitation scavenging and gas-aerosol partitioning not resolved by the model. The model yields an atmospheric lifetime of methylchloroform (proxy for global OH) of 5.1 years, as compared to a best estimate from observations of 5.5 plus or minus 0.8 years, and simulates H2O2 concentrations observed from aircraft with significant regional disagreements but no global bias. The OH concentrations are approximately 20% higher than in our previous global 3-D model which included an UV-absorbing aerosol. Concentrations of CO tend to be underestimated by the model, often by 10-30 ppb, which could reflect a combination of excessive OH (a 20% decrease in model OH could be accommodated by the methylchloroform constraint) and an underestimate of CO sources (particularly biogenic). The model underestimates observed acetone concentrations over the South Pacific in fall by a factor of 3; a missing source from the ocean may be implicated.},

abstract = {Global chemistry-transport models (CTMs) typically use simplified parameterizations or relaxation to climatology to estimate the chemical behavior of the stratosphere only in the context of its impact on tropospheric chemistry. This limits investigation of stratospheric chemistry and interactions between tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry-transport processes. We incorporate stratospheric chemical and physical processes into the model GEOS-Chem in the form of a unified chemistry extension (UCX). The stratospheric chemistry framework from NASA's Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) is updated in accordance with JPL 10-06 and combined with GEOS-Chem's existing widely applied and validated tropospheric chemistry to form a single, unified gas-phase chemistry scheme. Aerosol calculations are extended to include heterogeneous halogen chemistry and the formation, sedimentation and evaporation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) as well as background liquid binary sulfate (LBS) aerosols. The Fast-JX v7.0a photolysis scheme replaces a hybrid of Fast-J and Fast-JX v6.2, allowing photolytic destruction at frequencies relevant to the stratosphere and of species not previously modeled. Finally, new boundary conditions are implemented to cover both surface emissions of new species and mesospheric behavior. Results for four simulation years (2004-2007) are compared to those from the original, tropospheric model and to in situ and satellite-based measurements. We use these comparisons to show that the extended model is capable of modeling stratospheric chemistry efficiently without compromising the accuracy of the model at lower altitudes, perturbing mean OH below 250hPa by less than 5% while successfully capturing stratospheric behavior not previously captured in GEOS-Chem such as formation and collapse of the Antarctic ozone hole.

@article{Smit2007,
abstract = {[1] Since 1996, quality assurance experiments of electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes of two different model types (SPC-6A and ENSCI-Z) have been conducted in the environmental simulation facility at the Research Centre Juelich within the framework of the Juelich Ozone Sonde Intercomparison Experiment (JOSIE). The experiments have shown that the performance characteristics of the two ECC-sonde types can be significantly different, even when operated under the same conditions. Particularly above 20 km the ENSCI-Z sonde tends to measure 5–10% more ozone than the SPC-6A sonde. Below 20 km the differences are 5% or less, but appear to show some differences with year of manufacture. There is a significant difference in the ozone readings when sondes of the same type are operated with different cathode sensing solutions. Testing the most commonly used sensing solutions showed that for each ECC-manufacturer type the use of 1.0% KI and full buffer gives 5% larger ozone values compared with the use of 0.5% KI and half buffer, and as much as 10% larger values compared with 2.0% KI and no buffer. For ozone sounding stations performing long term measurements this means that changing the sensing solution type or ECC-sonde type can easily introduce a change of ±5% or more in their records, affecting determination of ozone trends. Standardization of operating procedures for ECC-sondes yields a precision better than ±(3–5)% and an accuracy of about ±(5–10)% up to 30 km altitude. Citation: Smit, H. G. J., et al.

The radioactivity measurements and machine-computed isentropic trajectories prove that stratospheric air from high latitudes is transported southward and downward into the troposphere as the tropopause folds. Changes in potential vorticity and the concentration of radioactivity along the trajectories also prove that subsynoptic-scale mixing destroys the extruded stratospheric layer in the troposphere.

We use a radiative fixed dynamical heating model to show that the effects of tropical ozone decreases at 70 hPa and lower pressures can lead to significant cooling not only at stratospheric levels, but also in the ''sub-stratosphere/ upper tropospheric'' region around 150-70 hPa. The impact of stratospheric ozone depletion on upper tropospheric temperatures stems from reduced longwave emission from above. The results provide a possible explanation for the long-standing discrepancy between modeled and measured temperature trends in the uppermost tropical troposphere and can explain the latitudinal near-homogeneity of recent stratospheric temperature trends.},

abstract = {The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 2.1 (MEGAN2.1) is a modeling framework for estimating fluxes of biogenic compounds between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere using simple mechanistic algorithms to account for the major known processes controlling biogenic emissions. It is available as an offline code and has also been coupled into land surface and atmospheric chemistry models. MEGAN2.1 is an update from the previous versions including MEGAN2.0, which was described for isoprene emissions by Guenther et al. (2006) and MEGAN2.02, which was described for monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions by Sakulyanontvittaya et al. (2008). Isoprene comprises about half of the total global biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission of 1 Pg (1000 Tg or 1015 g) estimated using MEGAN2.1. Methanol, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, t-beta-ocimene, limonene, ethene, and propene together contribute another 30% of the MEGAN2.1 estimated emission. An additional 20 compounds (mostly terpenoids) are associated with the MEGAN2.1 estimates of another 17% of the total emission with the remaining 3% distributed among >100 compounds. Emissions of 41 monoterpenes and 32 sesquiterpenes together comprise about 15% and 3 %, respectively, of the estimated total global BVOC emission. Tropical trees cover about 18% of the global land surface and are estimated to be responsible for similar to 80% of terpenoid emissions and similar to 50% of other VOC emissions. Other trees cover about the same area but are estimated to contribute only about 10% of total emissions. The magnitude of the emissions estimated with MEGAN2.1 are within the range of estimates reported using other approaches and much of the differences between reported values can be attributed to land cover and meteorological driving variables. The offline version of MEGAN2.1 source code and driving variables is available from http://bai.acd.ucar.edu/MEGAN/ and the version integrated into the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) can be downloaded from http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/.},

abstract = {This paper reviews current understanding of the sources and sinks of ozone in the troposphere, recent studies of long-term trends, and the factors which have to be taken into consideration when constructing and interpreting future models of ozone concentration. The factors controlling surface O3 concentrations are discussed initially to provide a basis for the ensuing discussion, followed by a summary of the evidence for recent trends in ground-level ozone concentrations, i.e. over the past 3 decades, which have shown a significant increase in the annual average in 'background' air typical of the unpolluted northern hemisphere. Closer to precursor sources, although urban winter concentrations have increased, rural peak spring and summer concentrations during ozone 'episodes' have decreased markedly in response to emissions reductions. In order to determine whether such trends are meaningful, the statistical techniques for determining temporal trends are reviewed. The possible causes of long-term trends in ozone are then discussed, with particular reference to the use of chemistry-transport models to interpret past trends. Such models are also used to make predictions of future trends in surface ozone concentrations, but few are comprehensive in integrating future climate changes with changes in land use and in emissions of ozone precursors. Guidance is given on the likely effects of climate/precursor/chemistry interactions so that model predictions can be judged.},

abstract = {Stratospheric-tropospheric exchange (STE) processes contribute at both high and low-elevation monitoring sites to background ozone (O3) concentrations. This study addresses the importance of stratospheric intrusions contributing to enhanced hourly average surface O3 concentrations (i.e., ???50ppb) at 12 O3 monitoring stations in the western and northern tier of the US for 2006, 2007, and 2008. The Lagrangian Analysis Tool (LAGRANTO) trajectory model identified specific days when stratosphere-to-troposphere transport was optimal to elevate surface O3 levels. The coincidences between the number of days with a daily maximum hourly average O3 concentration???50ppb and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport to surface (STT-S>0) were quantified. The high-elevation site at Yellowstone National Park (NP) in Wyoming exhibited the most coincidences (i.e., more than 19 days a month) during the spring and summer for hourly average O3 concentrations???50ppb with STT-S>0 of the 12 monitoring sites. At this site, the daily maximum hourly springtime average O3 concentrations were usually in the 60-70ppb range. The maximum daily 8-h average concentrations mostly ranged from 50 to 65ppb. At many of the lower-elevation sites, there was a preference for O3 enhancements to be coincident with STT-S>0 during the springtime, although summertime occurrences were sometimes observed. When statistically significant coincidences occurred, the daily maximum hourly average concentrations were mostly in the 50-65ppb range and the daily maximum 8-h average concentrations were usually in the 50-62ppb range. For many cases, the coincidences between the enhancements and the STT-S events occurred over a continuous multiday period. Supplementary observations, such as (1) the greater frequency of O3 concentration enhancements occurring during the springtime versus other times of the year, (2) the elevation dependency of the frequency of enhancements, (3) the year-to-year variability, (4) the timing of the hour-by-hour occurrences of the O3 concentration enhancements within and across monitoring sites, and (5) the detailed analyses of O3 enhancement events at specific sites, provide additional support for our modeling and statistical results. Our analysis provides an important step in better understanding the variability of natural background O3 concentrations. The study has provided insight into stratospheric intrusions, with emphasis on the combined role of quasi-isentropic large-scale advection and mesoscale boundary layer turbulence for stratospheric air influencing enhanced surface O3. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {<p>In this study we examine the simulated downward transport and mixing of stratospheric air into the upper tropical troposphere as observed on a research flight during the SCOUT-O3 campaign in connection with a deep convective system. We use the Advanced Research Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model with a horizontal resolution of 333 m to examine this downward transport. The simulation reproduces the deep convective system, its timing and overshooting altitudes reasonably well compared to radar and aircraft observations. Passive tracers initialised at pre-storm times indicate the downward transport of air from the stratosphere to the upper troposphere as well as upward transport from the boundary layer into the cloud anvils and overshooting tops. For example, a passive ozone tracer (i.e. a tracer not undergoing chemical processing) shows an enhancement in the upper troposphere of up to about 30 ppbv locally in the cloud, while the in situ measurements show an increase of 50 ppbv. However, the passive carbon monoxide tracer exhibits an increase, while the observations show a decrease of about 10 ppbv, indicative of an erroneous model representation of the transport processes in the tropical tropopause layer. Furthermore, it could point to insufficient entrainment and detrainment in the model. The simulation shows a general moistening of air in the lower stratosphere, but it also exhibits local dehydration features. Here we use the model to explain the processes causing the transport and also expose areas of inconsistencies between the model and observations.</p>},

abstract = {The published literature debates the extent to which naturally occurring stratospheric ozone intrusions reach the surface and contribute to exceedances of the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone (75 ppbv implemented in 2008). Analysis of ozonesondes, lidar, and surface measurements over the western U.S. from April to June 2010 show that a global high-resolution (∼50 × 50 km2) chemistry-climate model (GFDL AM3) captures the observed layered features and sharp ozone gradients of deep stratospheric intrusions, representing a major improvement over previous chemical transport models. Thirteen intrusions enhanced total daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ozone to ∼70–86 ppbv at surface sites. With a stratospheric ozone tracer defined relative to a dynamically varying tropopause, we find that stratospheric intrusions can episodically increase surface MDA8 ozone by 20–40 ppbv (all model estimates are bias corrected), including on days when observed ozone exceeds the NAAQS threshold. These stratospheric intrusions elevated background ozone concentrations (estimated by turning off North American anthropogenic emissions in the model) to MDA8 values of 60–75 ppbv. At high-elevation western U.S. sites, the 25th–75th percentile of the stratospheric contribution is 15–25 ppbv when observed MDA8 ozone is 60–70 ppbv, and increases to ∼17–40 ppbv for the 70–85 ppbv range. These estimates, up to 2–3 times greater than previously reported, indicate a major role for stratospheric intrusions in contributing to springtime high-O3events over the high-altitude western U.S., posing a challenge for staying below the ozone NAAQS threshold, particularly if a value in the 60–70 ppbv range were to be adopted.},

abstract = {This paper gives a synthesis of three algorithms to detect the presence of tropopause folds from vertical ozone/radio-sounding profiles and from meteorological analysis. Also an algorithm to identify injection of stratospheric air into the lower troposphere from ozone/ 7 beryllium time series is presented. Differences in the results obtained from the algorithms are observed and discussed with respect to the criteria for fold detection and input data used. Spatial gradients in the obtained folding frequencies are made evident on a global scale from the algorithm based on meteorological analysis (Q-vector/potential vorticity) and probably also on a regional European scale from algorithms both based meteorological analyses and on ozone/PTU soundings. The observed seasonal variation of folding occurrence is rather flat except during summer when also some differences appear between the algorithms. By combining the folding frequencies with literature estimates of the cross-tropopause ozone transfer in single folding events, an average stratospheric ozone influx into the troposphere of 5:7 1:3 10 10 mol. cm ,2 s ,1 is obtained for the Northern hemisphere and 12 2:7 10 10 mol. cm ,2 s ,1 for Western Europe. Potential additional contributions due to other stratosphere-troposphere exchange processes than folds are not yet included in these estimates. Finally, the link between statistics from ozone/ 7 beryllium data and folding statistics is briefly discussed.},

A proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was used to monitor the evolution of gas-phase products, identified by their mass to charge ratio (m/z). Several gas-phase oxidation products, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone, acetic acid, and nopinone, were identified and calibrated. Aerosol yields, and the yields of these identified and calibrated oxidation products, as well as many higher m/z oxidation products observed with the PTR-MS, varied significantly between the different parent terpene compounds. The sum of measured oxidation products in the gas and particle phase ranged from 33 to 77% of the carbon in the reacted terpenes, suggesting there are still unmeasured products from these reactions. The observations of the higher molecular weight oxidation product ions provide evidence of previously unreported compounds and their temporal evolution in the smog chamber from multistep oxidation processes. Many of the observed ions, including m/z 111 and 113, have also been observed in ambient air above a Ponderosa pine forest canopy, and our results confirm they are consistent with products from terpene + O3 reactions. Many of these products are stable on the timescale of our experiments and can therefore be monitored in field campaigns as evidence for ozone oxidative chemistry. Citation:},

abstract = {<p>Space-borne observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) are frequently used to derive surface emissions of isoprene, an important biogenic volatile organic compound. The conversion of retrieved HCHO slant column concentrations from satellite line-of-sight measurements to vertical columns is determined through application of an air mass factor (AMF), accounting for instrument viewing geometry, radiative transfer, and vertical profile of the absorber in the atmosphere. This step in the trace gas retrieval is subject to large errors. This work presents the AMF algorithm in use at the University of Leicester (UoL), which introduces scene-specific variables into a per-observation full radiative transfer AMF calculation, including increasing spatial resolution of key environmental parameter databases, input variable area weighting, instrument-specific scattering weight calculation, and inclusion of an ozone vertical profile climatology. Application of these updates to HCHO slant columns from the GOME-2 instrument is shown to typically adjust the AMF by ±20 %, compared to a reference algorithm without these advanced parameterisations. On average the GOME-2 AMFs increase by 4 %, with over 70 % of locations having an AMF of 0–20 % larger than originally, largely resulting from the use of the latest GOME-2 reflectance product. Furthermore, the new UoL algorithm also incorporates a full radiative transfer error calculation for each scene to help characterise AMF uncertainties. Global median AMF errors are typically 50–60 %, and are driven by uncertainties in the HCHO profile shape and its vertical distribution relative to clouds and aerosols. If uncertainty on the a priori HCHO profile is relatively small (< 10 %) then the median AMF total error decreases to about 30–40 %.</p>},

abstract = {As an ubiquitous product of the oxidation of many volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde (HCHO) plays a key role as a short-lived and reactive intermediate in the atmospheric photo-oxidation pathways leading to the formation of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols. In this study, HCHO profiles have been successfully retrieved from ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) solar spectra and UV-visible Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) scans recorded during the July 2010-December 2012 time period at the Jungfraujoch station (Swiss Alps, 46.5 degrees N, 8.0 degrees E, 3580 ma.s.l.). Analysis of the retrieved products has revealed different vertical sensitivity between both remote sensing techniques. Furthermore, HCHO amounts simulated by two state-of-the-art chemical transport models (CTMs), GEOS-Chem and IMAGES v2, have been compared to FTIR total columns and MAX-DOAS 3.6-8 km partial columns, accounting for the respective vertical resolution of each ground-based instrument. Using the CTM outputs as the intermediate, FTIR and MAX-DOAS retrievals have shown consistent seasonal modulations of HCHO throughout the investigated period, characterized by summertime maximum and wintertime minimum. Such comparisons have also highlighted that FTIR and MAX-DOAS provide complementary products for the HCHO retrieval above the Jungfraujoch station. Finally, tests have revealed that the updated IR parameters from the HITRAN 2012 database have a cumulative effect and significantly decrease the retrieved HCHO columns with respect to the use of the HITRAN 2008 compilation.},

abstract = {We analyze a 1 year campaign of 17 ozonesondes launched in 2008-2009 at Kerguelen Island (49.2S, 70.1E), the first such soundings performed at this location. Tropospheric ozone presents a large variability in austral summer (December to February) and austral winter (June to September). The baseline tropospheric ozone is higher in winter (between 30 and 50 ppbv) than in summer (between 20 and 40 ppbv). We compare these observations to a data set obtained during the same period at Lauder (45.0S, 169.7E), which presents a marked seasonal pattern. The analysis of trajectory runs and reanalysis output help identify two significant contributors to the tropospheric ozone level at Kerguelen: the stratosphere-to-troposphere air mass transport and the long-range transport of biomass burning plumes. The stratosphere-to-troposphere transport is exemplified by a case study of a dry and enriched ozone layer over Kerguelen (70 ppbv at an altitude of 6 km on 28 February 2009). Using Lagrangian model simulations, we show that wintertime enhancement of the tropospheric ozone baseline can be partially attributed to the long-range transport of ozone precursors from biomass burning plumes originating in southern America and Africa. However, owing to limited data and to the many factors that can cause this wintertime baseline ozone enhancement, further investigations are needed to fully explain it. Additional measurements are also needed to establish an ozone climatology, to further characterize the ozone annual cycle and wintertime enhancement, and to better compare Kerguelen with other midlatitude sites.},

In the study, 628 ECC-type ozonesonde profiles from four stations in northern Europe were used. Two tropopauses were defined for each profile: a thermal tropopause and an ozone tropopause defined in terms of both mixing ratio and vertical gradient of mixing ratio. On average, the ozone tropopause lay 800 m below the thermal. Large differences in tropopause height were associated with indefinite thermal tropopauses which were, in turn, often associated with cyclonic conditions (some corresponding to profiles taken within the stratospheric polar vortex). On almost all profiles the thermal tropopause was the higher of the two, and of the 15 profiles that did not fit this pattern, two-thirds were associated with anticyclonic flow in the upper troposphere. It is also shown that the tropopause definition impacts greatly on the evaluation of the ozone content of the troposphere. Where the thermal tropopause is indefinite in character, on average 27% of the ozone found below the thermal tropopause lies above the ozone tropopause.},

In this study we use the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and a refined version of a previously developed Lagrangian methodology to compile a global 33 yr climatology of stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE) from 1979 to 2011. Fluxes of mass and ozone are calculated across the tropopause, pressure surfaces in the troposphere, and the top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). This climatology provides a state-of-the-art quantification of the geographical distribution of STE and the preferred transport pathways, as well as insight into the temporal evolution of STE during the last 33 yr. We confirm the distinct zonal and seasonal asymmetry found in previous studies using comparable methods. The subset of deep STE, where stratospheric air reaches the PBL within 4 days or vice versa, shows especially strong geographical and seasonal variations. The global hotspots for deep STE are found along the west coast of North America and over the Tibetan Plateau, especially in boreal winter and spring. An analysis of the time series reveals significant positive trends of the net downward mass flux and of deep STE in both directions, which are particularly large over North America. The downward ozone flux across the tropopause is dominated by the seasonal cycle of ozone concentrations at the tropopause and peaks in summer, when the mass flux is nearly at its minimum. For the subset of deep STE events, the situation is reversed and the downward ozone flux into the PBL is dominated by the mass flux and peaks in early spring. Thus surface ozone concentration along the west coast of North America and around the Tibetan Plateau are likely to be influenced by deep stratospheric intrusions. We discuss the sensitivity of our results on the choice of the control surface representing the tropopause, the horizontal and vertical resolution of the trajectory starting grid, and the minimum residence time $\tau$ used to filter out transient STE trajectories.} Latitude based analogy of where STTs and deep STTs occur},

The northernmost station at Sapporo (44N, 141E) is the most affected by stratosphere/troposphere exchange. This exchange is observed to be associated with the advection of laminae of high and low ozone mixing ration in the stratosphere. A case study is made of a cut-off low over Tateno on 12 April 1989. Between 10 and 11 April, there was increase in total column ozone of 71 \{DU\} over Tateno, due to an increase of ozone mixing ratio between 400 and 200 mbar. Dynamical analysis showed that vortex stretching alone could account for only about half of this increase; advection of a lamina of high ozone concentration from the north made up the difference. Thus, to model the cross-tropopause flux of trace gases correctly, the dynamics of the lower stratosphere must be included.},

abstract = {Biomass burning is a major source of pollution in the tropical Southern Hemisphere, and fine mode carbonaceous particles are produced by the same combustion processes that emit carbon monoxide (CO). In this paper we examine these emissions with data from the Terra satellite, CO profiles from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, and fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The satellite measurements are used in conjunction with calculations from the MOZART chemical transport model to examine the 2003 Southern Hemisphere burning season with particular emphasis on the months of peak fire activity in September and October. Pollutant emissions follow the occurrence of dry season fires, and the temporal variation and spatial distributions of MOPITT CO and MODIS AOD are similar. We examine the outflow from Africa and South America with emphasis on the impact of these emissions on clean remote regions. We present comparisons of MOPITT observations and ground-based interferometer data from Lauder, New Zealand, which indicate that intercontinental transport of biomass burning pollution from Africa often determines the local air quality. The correlation between enhancements of AOD and CO column for distinct biomass burning plumes is very good with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8. We present a method using MOPITT and MODIS data for estimating the emission ratio of aerosol number density to CO concentration which could prove useful as input to modeling studies. We also investigate decay of plumes from African fires following export into the Indian Ocean and compare the MOPITT and MODIS measurements as a way of estimating the regional aerosol lifetime. Vertical transport of biomass burning emissions is also examined using CO profile information. Low-altitude concentrations are very high close to source regions, but further downwind of the continents, vertical mixing takes place and results in more even CO vertical distributions. In regions of significant convection, particularly in the equatorial Indian Ocean, the CO mixing ratio is greater at higher altitudes, indicating vertical transport of biomass burning emissions to the upper troposphere.},

abstract = {Tropospheric ozone (O3) negatively impacts human health and ecosystems, and is a greenhouse gas. Wildfires are a source of tropospheric O 3, and studies show that wildfires are increasing in North America. In this study, we present a critical review of O3 production from wildfires focusing on three key topics: the influence of wildfire emissions on O3 production; the influence of photochemistry on wildfire O3 production; and regulatory issues associated with wildfire O3 production in the United States. Observations of O3/CO range from approximately -0.1 to 0.9, and are caused by the interplay of numerous factors including fire emissions, efficiency of combustion, chemical and photochemical reactions, aerosol effects on chemistry and radiation, and local and downwind meteorological patterns. Using average O3/CO ratios for major biomes, we estimate global wildfires produce approximately 170 Tg of O3 per year, which is 3.5% of all global tropospheric O3 production. Areas of uncertainty in wildfire O3 production include the net effect of aerosols on chemical and photochemical reactions within a fire plume, the impact of oxygenated volatile organic compounds and nitrous acid on O3 production, and the interplay of variables that lead to extreme O3/CO values. Because wildfire frequencies are likely increasing and have been shown to contribute to elevated O3 at air quality monitoring sites, it is important to better understand the emissions, photochemistry and impacts of these fires.},

abstract = {The transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa to the neighboring Atlantic and Indian Oceans during the dry season (May-October) of 2000 is characterized using ground, ozonesonde, and aircraft measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3) in and around southern Africa, together with the GEOS-CHEM global model of tropospheric chemistry. The model shows a positive bias of approximately 20% for CO and a negative bias of approximately 10-25% for O3 at oceanic sites downwind of fire emissions. Near areas of active fire emissions the model shows a negative bias of approximately 60% and approximately 30% for CO and O3, respectively, likely due to the coarse spatial (2 deg. x 2.5 deg.) and temporal (monthly) resolution of the model compared to that of active fires. On average, from 1994 to 2000, approximately 60 Tg of carbon monoxide (CO) from biomass burning in southern Africa was transported eastward to the Indian Ocean across the latitude band 0 deg. -60 S during the 6 months of the dry season. Over the same time period, approximately 40 Tg of CO from southern African biomass burning was transported westward to the Atlantic Ocean over the latitudes 0 deg. -20 S during the 6-month dry season, but most of that amount was transported back eastward over higher latitudes to the south (21 deg. -60 S). Eastward transport of biomass burning emissions from southern Africa enhances CO concentrations by approximately 4- 13 ppbv per month over the southern subtropical Indian Ocean during the dry season, with peak enhancements in September. Carbon monoxide from southern African and South American biomass burning is seen in the model simulations as far away as Australia, contributing approximately 8 ppbv and approximately 12-15 ppbv CO, respectively, and thus explaining the approximately 20- 25 ppbv observed enhancement of CO over Melbourne in mid-September 2000.},

abstract = {The European carbon monoxide (CO) budget is studied in relation to the synoptic circulation throughout 2001, using the nested-grid configuration of the GEOS-CHEM global model and CO measurements from 31 rural background stations. To meet the aims of this study, a seasonal circulation type (CT) classification is developed for the Northern Hemisphere based on mean sea-level pressure (SLP) fields, as well as two upper atmospheric levels, over a 60-yr period. The highest contribution to the European surface CO concentrations is attributed to regional anthropogenic sources (up to $\sim$80%), which become more important under the prevalence of anticyclonic circulation conditions. The corresponding contribution of the long-range transport (LRT) from North America (up to 18%) and Asia (up to 20%) is found highest (lowest) in winter and spring (summer and autumn). The transport of the CO towards Europe in winter is more intense under cyclonic circulation, while both cyclonic and anticyclonic patterns favour LRT during other seasons. Occasionally (mainly in winter and spring), LRT contribution is higher than the regional one (up to 45%). In the free troposphere, the LRT contribution increases, with the largest impact originating from Asia. This flow is favoured by the intense easterly circulation in summer, contributing up to 30% in the Eastern Mediterranean during this season. On the other hand, the regional contribution in the upper levels decreases to 22%. The contribution of CO chemical production is significant for the European CO budget at all levels and seasons, exceeding 50% in the free troposphere during summer.},

abstract = {<p>We investigate the impact of biogenic emissions on carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), with simulations using two different biogenic emission inventories for isoprene and monoterpenes. Results from four atmospheric chemistry models are compared to continuous long-term ground-based CO and HCHO column measurements at the SH Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) sites, the satellite measurement of tropospheric CO columns from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and in situ surface CO measurements from across the SH, representing a subset of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Monitoring Division (NOAA GMD) network. Simulated mean model CO using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (v2.1) computed in the frame work of the Land Community Model (CLM-MEGANv2.1) inventory is in better agreement with both column and surface observations than simulations adopting the emission inventory generated from the LPJ-GUESS dynamical vegetation model framework, which markedly underestimate measured column and surface CO at most sites. Differences in biogenic emissions cause large differences in CO in the source regions which propagate to the remote SH. Significant inter-model differences exist in modelled column and surface CO, and secondary production of CO dominates these inter-model differences, due mainly to differences in the models' oxidation schemes for volatile organic compounds, predominantly isoprene oxidation. While biogenic emissions are a significant factor in modelling SH CO, inter-model differences pose an additional challenge to constrain these emissions. Corresponding comparisons of HCHO columns at two SH mid-latitude sites reveal that all models significantly underestimate the observed values by approximately a factor of 2. There is a much smaller impact on HCHO of the significantly different biogenic emissions in remote regions, compared to the source regions. Decreased biogenic emissions cause decreased CO export to remote regions, which leads to increased OH; this in turn results in increased HCHO production through methane oxidation. In agreement with earlier studies, we corroborate that significant HCHO sources are likely missing in the models in the remote SH.</p>},

abstract = {Ozone holds a certain fascination in atmospheric science. It is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, central to tropospheric oxidation chemistry, yet harmful to human and ecosystem health as well as being an important greenhouse gas. It is not emitted into the atmosphere but is a byproduct of the very oxidation chemistry it largely initiates. Much effort is focused on the reduction of surface levels of ozone owing to its health and vegetation impacts, but recent efforts to achieve reductions in exposure at a country scale have proved difficult to achieve owing to increases in background ozone at the zonal hemispheric scale. There is also a growing realisation that the role of ozone as a short-lived climate pollutant could be important in integrated air quality climate change mitigation. This review examines current understanding of the processes regulating tropospheric ozone at global to local scales from both measurements and models. It takes the view that knowledge across the scales is important for dealing with air quality and climate change in a synergistic manner. The review shows that there remain a number of clear challenges for ozone such as explaining surface trends, incorporating new chemical understanding, ozone–climate coupling, and a better assessment of impacts. There is a clear and present need to treat ozone across the range of scales, a transboundary issue, but with an emphasis on the hemispheric scales. New observational opportunities are offered both by satellites and small sensors that bridge the scales.},

abstract = {The chemical link between isoprene and formaldehyde (HCHO) is a strong, non-linear function of NOx (= NO + NO2). This relationship is a linchpin for top-down isoprene emission inventory verification from orbital HCHO column observations. It is also a benchmark for overall mechanism performance with regard to VOC oxidation. Using a comprehensive suite of airborne in situ observations over the Southeast US, we quantify HCHO production across the urban-rural spectrum. Analysis of isoprene and its major first-generation oxidation products allows us to define both a "prompt" yield of HCHO (molecules of HCHO produced per molecule of freshly-emitted isoprene) and the background HCHO mixing ratio (from oxidation of longer-lived hydrocarbons). Over the range of observed NOx values (roughly 0.1–2 ppbv), the prompt yield increases by a factor of 3 (from 0.3 to 0.9 ppbv ppbv−1), while background HCHO increases by more than a factor of 2 (from 1.5 to 3.3 ppbv). We apply the same method to evaluate the performance of both a global chemical transport model (AM3) and a measurement-constrained 0-D chemical box model. Both models reproduce the NOx dependence of the prompt HCHO yield, illustrating that models with updated isoprene oxidation mechanisms can adequately capture the link between HCHO and recent isoprene emissions. On the other hand, both models under-estimate background HCHO mixing ratios, suggesting missing HCHO precursors, inadequate representation of later-generation isoprene degradation and/or under-estimated hydroxyl radical concentrations. Moreover, we find that the total organic peroxy radical production rate is essentially independent of NOx, as the increase in oxidizing capacity with NOx is largely balanced by a decrease in VOC reactivity. Thus, the observed NOx dependence of HCHO mainly reflects the changing fate of organic peroxy radicals.},

All models applied a common set of anthropogenic emissions, which are better constrained for the present-day than the past. Future anthropogenic emissions follow the four Representative Concn. Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which define a relatively narrow range of possible air pollution emissions. We calc. a value for the pre-industrial (1750) to present-day (2010) tropospheric ozone RF of 410 mW m-2. The model range of pre-industrial to present-day changes in O3 produces a spread ({\^{A}}±1 std. deviation) in RFs of {\^{A}}±17%. Three different radiation schemes were used - we find differences in RFs between schemes (for the same ozone fields) of {\^{A}}±10%. Applying two different tropopause definitions gives differences in RFs of {\^{A}}±3%. Given addnl. (unquantified) uncertainties assocd. with emissions, climate-chem. interactions and land-use change, we est. an overall uncertainty of {\^{A}}±30% for the tropospheric ozone RF. Expts. carried out by a subset of six models attribute tropospheric ozone RF to increased emissions of methane (44 {\^{A}}± 12 %), nitrogen oxides (31 {\^{A}}± 9 %), carbon monoxide (15 {\^{A}}± 3 %) and non-methane volatile org. compds. (9 {\^{A}}± 2 %); earlier studies attributed more of the tropospheric ozone RF to methane and less to nitrogen oxides. Normalizing RFs to changes in tropospheric column ozone, we find a global mean normalized RF of 42 mW m-2 DU-1, a value similar to previous work. Using normalized RFs and future tropospheric column ozone projections we calc. future tropospheric ozone RFs (mW m-2; relative to 1750) for the four future scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) of 350, 420, 370 and 460 (in 2030), and 200, 300, 280 and 600 (in 2100). Models show some coherent responses of ozone to climate change: decreases in the tropical lower troposphere, assocd. with increases in water vapor; and increases in the sub-tropical to mid-latitude upper troposphere, assocd. with increases in lightning and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport.

We present seven years (1995 - 2001) of HCHO column data for North America from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and show that the general seasonal and interannual variability of these data is consistent with knowledge of isoprene emission. There are some significant regional discrepancies with the seasonal patterns predicted from current isoprene emission models, and we suggest that these may reflect flaws in the models.

abstract = {The oxidative capacity of past atmospheres is highly uncertain. We present here a new climate-biosphere-chemistry modeling framework to determine oxidant levels in the present and past troposphere. We use the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven by meteorological fields from the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS) ModelE, with land cover and fire emissions from dynamic global vegetation models. We present time-slice simulations for the present day, late preindustrial era (AD 1770), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 19-23 ka), and we test the sensitivity of model results to uncertainty in lightning and fire emissions. We find that most preindustrial and paleo climate simulations yield reduced oxidant levels relative to the present day. Contrary to prior studies, tropospheric mean OH in our ensemble shows little change at the LGM relative to the preindustrial era (0.5 ± 12 %), despite large reductions in methane concentrations. We find a simple linear relationship between tropospheric mean ozone photolysis rates, water vapor, and total emissions of NOx and reactive carbon that explains 72 % of the variability in global mean OH in 11 different simulations across the last glacial-interglacial time interval and the industrial era. Key parameters controlling the tropospheric oxidative capacity over glacial-interglacial periods include overhead stratospheric ozone, tropospheric water vapor, and lightning NOx emissions. Variability in global mean OH since the LGM is insensitive to fire emissions. Our simulations are broadly consistent with ice-core records of $\Delta$17O in sulfate and nitrate at the LGM, and CO, HCHO, and H2O2 in the preindustrial era. Our results imply that the glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric methane observed in ice cores are predominantly driven by changes in its sources as opposed to its sink with OH.},

@article{Zanis2003,
abstract = {Abstract. A wide range of measurements was carried out in central and southeastern Europe within the framework of the EU project STACCATO (Influence of Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange in a Changing Climate on Atmospheric Transport and Oxidation Capacity) with the principle goal to create a comprehensive data set on stratospheric air intrusions into the troposphere along a rather frequently observed pathway over central Europe from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The measurements were based on predictions by suitable quasi-operational trajectory calculations using ECMWF forecast data. A predicted deep Stratosphere to Troposphere Transport (STT) event, encountered during the STACCATO period on 20-21 June 2001, was followed by the measurements network almost from its inception. Observations provide evidence that the intrusion affected large parts of central and southeastern Europe. Especially, the ozone lidar observations on 20-21 June 2001 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany captured the evolution of two marked tongues of high ozone with the first one descending to nearly 2 km, thus providing an excellent data set for model intercomparisons and validation. In addition, for the first time to our knowledge concurrent surface measurements of the cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be and 7Be and their ratio 10Be/7Be are presented together as stratospheric tracers in a case study of a stratospheric intrusion. The ozone tracer columns calculated with the FLEXPART model were found to be in good agreement with water vapour satellite images, capturing the evolution of the observed dry streamers of stratospheric origin. Furthermore, the time-height cross section of ozone tracer simulated with FLEXPART over Garmisch-Partenkirchen captures many details of the evolution of the two observed high-ozone filaments measured with the IFU lidar, thus demonstrating the considerable progress in model simulations. Finally, the modelled ozone (operationally available since October 1999) from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric model is shown to be in very good agreement with the observations during this case study, which provides the first successful validation of a chemical tracer that is derived operationally from a weather forecast model. This suggests that coupling chemistry and weather forecast models may significantly improve both weather and chemical forecasts in the future.},

abstract = {A high-resolution section of dissolved iron (dFe) and aluminum (dAl) was obtained along $\sim$95°E in the upper 1000m of the eastern Indian Ocean from the Antarctic margin (66°S) to the Bay of Bengal (18°N) during the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) CO2 Repeat Hydrography I08S and I09N sections (February–April 2007). In the Southern Ocean, low concentrations of dAl (<1nM) reflect the negligible dust inputs impacting the water masses subducted in the circumpolar domain. The low dAl concentrations characterizing the Southern Ocean terminate near 45°S, probably because of the advection of subtropical water masses that received dust and sedimentary inputs in their formation region. Our subsurface dFe data near the southern Kerguelen Plateau were significantly higher than historical observations in other Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean. We surmise that the offshore advection of dFe-rich waters along the western flank of the southern Kerguelen plateau and enhanced vertical mixing could contribute to this elevated subsurface dFe inventory. Elevated subsurface particulate and dFe levels downstream of the northern Kerguelen Plateaumay reflect long-range lateral transport from the plateau's sediments and/or remineralization inputs. At the northern edge of the south Indian subtropical gyre, the deposition of Australian dust, possibly combined with the advection of dAl-enriched waters from the Indonesian Throughflow, creates a region of elevated dAl in the upper 400m but without a corresponding enrichment in dFe. In the northern Indian Ocean, the South Equatorial Current constitutes a remarkable biogeochemical front separating the oxygen-rich and dFe-poor subtropical gyre waters from the dFe-rich and oxygen-depleted waters of the northern Indian Ocean. By tracing the accumulation of macronutrients and dFe along the advective pathway of Indian Central Water, we show that the central waters of the northern Indian Ocean receive excess dFe in addition to that produced by remineralization inputs. The resuspension of shelf sediments and release of pore waters probably contribute},

abstract = {Abstract. Tropopause folds are one of the mechanisms of stratosphere–troposphere exchange, which can bring ozone rich stratospheric air to low altitudes in the extra-tropical regions. They have been widely studied at northern mid- or high latitudes, but so far almost no studies have been made at mid- or high southern latitudes. The Moveable Atmospheric Radar for Antarctica (MARA), a 54.5 MHz wind-profiler radar, has operated at the Swedish summer station Wasa, Antarctica (73° S, 13.5° W) during austral summer seasons from 2007 to 2011 and has observed on several occasions signatures similar to those caused by tropopause folds at comparable Arctic latitudes. Here a case study is presented of one of these events when an ozonesonde successfully sampled the fold. Analysis from European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) is used to study the circumstances surrounding the event, and as boundary conditions for a mesoscale simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The fold is well resolved by the WRF simulation, and occurs on the poleward side of the polar jet stream. However, MARA resolves fine-scale layering associated with the fold better than the WRF simulation.},

abstract = {Environmental Context. Many plant species biosynthesize and emit the volatile hydrocarbon isoprene. Once in the atmosphere, isoprene is susceptible to a range of reactions involving potentially hundred of products and intermediate compounds. The products of these reactions in turn may pose a risk to human and plant health and impact the climate through the generation of acids, ozone, and atmospheric aerosols. Abstract. The atmospheric oxidation mechanism of isoprene initiated by OH, O3, NO3, and Cl, which incorporates the most recent laboratory and theoretical studies, is described. A box model intercomparison between the new mechanism and previous available isoprene oxidation mechanisms has been performed. Ozone and OH concentrations are compared with predictions by the previous mechanisms in high and low NOx scenarios. The O3 and OH sensitivities to the chlorine-isoprene reactions have also been investigated by comparing the box model results with and without the chlorine-isoprene reactions, showing that the ozone production rate and OH concentrations are slightly impacted. The new mechanism facilitates more accurate modelling of isoprene photochemistry in the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method is used extensively to retrieve total column amounts of trace gases based on UV-visible measurements of satellite spectrometers, such as ERS-2 GOME. In practice the sensitivity of the instrument to the tracer density is strongly height dependent, especially in the troposphere. The resulting tracer profile dependence may introduce large systematic errors in the retrieved columns that are difficult to quantify without proper additional information, as provided by the averaging kernel (AK). In this paper we discuss the DOAS retrieval method in the context of the general retrieval theory as developed by Rodgers. An expression is derived for the DOAS AK for optically thin absorbers. It is shown that the comparison with 3D chemistry-transport models and independent profile measurements, based on averaging kernels, is no longer influenced by errors resulting from a priori profile assumptions. The availability of averaging kernel information as part of the total column retrieval product is important for the interpretation of the observations, and for applications like chemical data assimilation and detailed satellite validation studies.},

abstract = {We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to estimate the impact of transpacific transport of mineral dust on aerosol concentrations in North America during 2001. We have implemented two dust mobilization schemes in the model (GOCART and DEAD) and find that the best simulation of North American surface observations with GEOS-Chem is achieved by combining the topographic source used in GOCART with the entrainment scheme used in DEAD. This combination restricts dust emissions to year-round arid areas but includes a significant wind threshold for dust mobilization. The model captures the magnitude and seasonal cycle of observed surface dust concentrations over the northern Pacific. It simulates the free tropospheric outflow of dust from Asia observed in the TRACE-P and ACE-Asia aircraft campaigns of spring 2001. It reproduces the timing and distribution of Asian dust outbreaks in North America during April-May. Beyond these outbreaks we find persistent Asian fine dust (averaging 1.2 ??g m-3) in surface air over the western United States in spring, with much weaker influence (0.25 ??g m-3) in summer and fall. Asian influence over the eastern United States is 30-50% lower. We find that transpacific sources accounted for 41% of the worst dust days in the western United States in 2001. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Slant columns are determined to {<} 4e15 molecules cm2 sensitivity by directly fitting GOME radiance measurements. These show a distinct enhancement over the southeastern United States, consistent with a large regional source from oxidation of non methane hydrocarbons including in particular isoprene. Conversion of slant to vertical columns is done by combining species vertical distribution information from the GEOS-CHEM tropospheric chemistry and transport model with scattering weights from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory LIDORT multiple scattering radiative transfer model. The results demonstrate the ability to measure HCHO from space in typical continental atmospheres, and imply that space based measurements of HCHO may provide valuable information on emission fluxes of reactive hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {A new methodology is proposed to identify folds of the dynamical tropopause (taken as the 2 potential vorticity (PV) units (pvu) isosurface) from global analysis data sets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It consists of a three-dimensional subdivision of the atmosphere into stratospheric and tropospheric parts and a subsequent examination of multiple tropopause crossings in vertical profiles of the analyses. The method is applied to a 1-year period starting in March 2000. Seasonal mean fold frequency distributions show that folds occur preferentially in the subtropics, with maximum frequencies of about 30%. Pronounced maxima are located in the subtropical bands that extend from 20{\^{A}}°E to 120{\^{A}}°E on both hemispheres during summer. Generally, subtropical folds are comparatively shallow. Deep folds occur most frequently in midlatitudes during winter (over eastern North America and the western North Atlantic), with maximum frequencies of about 1%. Detailed investigation of the relationship between individual folds and cross-tropopause exchange events reveals that, on the average, individual folds in the extratropics are associated with larger exchange mass fluxes compared to the subtropics. However, due to the much higher frequency of subtropical folds, the percentage of exchange events that are associated with tropopause folds is larger near 20{\^{A}}°{\^{a}}€“40{\^{A}}° latitude (50{\^{a}}€“70%) than further poleward (20{\^{a}}€“30% during winter and 10{\^{a}}€“20% during summer). This indicates that tropopause folds are the key feature for cross-tropopause exchange in the subtropics, whereas in the extratropics other tropopause structures are at least of equal importance.},

abstract = {We conducted an extended follow-up and spatial analysis of the American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) cohort in order to further examine associations between long-term exposure to particulate air pollution and mortality in large U.S. cities. The current study sought to clarify outstanding scientific issues that arose from our earlier HEI-sponsored Reanalysis of the original ACS study data (the Particle Epidemiology Reanalysis Project). Specifically, we examined (1) how ecologic covariates at the community and neighborhood levels might confound and modify the air pollution-mortality association; (2) how spatial autocorrelation and multiple levels of data (e.g., individual and neighborhood) can be taken into account within the random effects Cox model; (3) how using land-use regression to refine measurements of air pollution exposure to the within-city (or intra-urban) scale might affect the size and significance of health effects in the Los Angeles and New York City regions; and (4) what exposure time windows may be most critical to the air pollution-mortality association. The 18 years of follow-up (extended from 7 years in the original study [Pope et al. 1995]) included vital status data for the CPS-II cohort (approximately 1.2 million participants) with multiple cause-of-death codes through December 31, 2000 and more recent exposure data from air pollution monitoring sites for the metropolitan areas. In the Nationwide Analysis, the influence of ecologic covariate data (such as education attainment, housing characteristics, and level of income; data obtained from the 1980 U.S. Census; see Ecologic Covariates sidebar on page 14) on the air pollution-mortality association were examined at the Zip Code area (ZCA) scale, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) scale, and by the difference between each ZCA value and the MSA value (DIFF). In contrast to previous analyses that did not directly include ecologic covariates at the ZCA scale, risk estimates increased when ecologic covariates were included at all scales. The ecologic covariates exerted their greatest effect on mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD), which was also the health outcome most strongly related with exposure to PM2.5 (particles 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter), sulfate (SO4(2-)), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), and the only outcome significantly associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). When ecologic covariates were simultaneously included at both the MSA and DIFF levels, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality from IHD associated with PM2.5 exposure (average concentration for 1999-2000) increased by 7.5% and that associated with SO4(2-) exposure (average concentration for 1990) increased by 12.8%. The two covariates found to exert the greatest confounding influence on the PM2.5-mortality association were the percentage of the population with a grade 12 education and the median household income. Also in the Nationwide Analysis, complex spatial patterns in the CPS-II data were explored with an extended random effects Cox model (see Glossary of Statistical Terms at end of report) that is capable of clustering up to two geographic levels of data. Using this model tended to increase the HR estimate for exposure to air pollution and also to inflate the uncertainty in the estimates. Including ecologic covariates decreased the variance of the results at both the MSA and ZCA scales; the largest decrease was in residual variation based on models in which the MSA and DIFF levels of data were included together, which suggests that partitioning the ecologic covariates into between-MSA and within-MSA values more completely captures the sources of variation in the relationship between air pollution, ecologic covariates, and mortality. Intra-Urban Analyses were conducted for the New York City and Los Angeles regions. The results of the Los Angeles spatial analysis, where we found high exposure contrasts within the Los Angeles region, showed that air pollution-mortality risks were nearly 3 times greater than those reported from earlier analyses. This suggests that chronic health effects associated with intra-urban gradients in exposure to PM2.5 may be even larger between ZCAs within an MSA than the associations between MSAs that have been previously reported. However, in the New York City spatial analysis, where we found very little exposure contrast between ZCAs within the New York region, mortality from all causes, cardiopulmonary disease (CPD), and lung cancer was not elevated. A positive association was seen for PM2.5 exposure and IHD, which provides evidence of a specific association with a cause of death that has high biologic plausibility. These results were robust when analyses controlled (1) the 44 individual-level covariates (from the ACS enrollment questionnaire in 1982; see 44 Individual-Level Covariates sidebar on page 22) and (2) spatial clustering using the random effects Cox model. Effects were mildly lower when unemployment at the ZCA scale was included. To examine whether there is a critical exposure time window that is primarily responsible for the increased mortality associated with ambient air pollution, we constructed individual time-dependent exposure profiles for particulate and gaseous air pollutants (PM2.5 and SO2) for a subset of the ACS CPS-II participants for whom residence histories were available. The relevance of the three exposure time windows we considered was gauged using the magnitude of the relative risk (HR) of mortality as well as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which measures the goodness of fit of the model to the data. For PM2.5, no one exposure time window stood out as demonstrating the greatest HR; nor was there any clear pattern of a trend in HR going from recent to more distant windows or vice versa. Differences in AIC values among the three exposure time windows were also small. The HRs for mortality associated with exposure to SO2 were highest in the most recent time window (1 to 5 years), although none of these HRs were significantly elevated. Identifying critical exposure time windows remains a challenge that warrants further work with other relevant data sets. This study provides additional support toward developing cost-effective air quality management policies and strategies. The epidemiologic results reported here are consistent with those from other population-based studies, which collectively have strongly supported the hypothesis that long-term exposure to PM2.5 increases mortality in the general population. Future research using the extended Cox-Poisson random effects methods, advanced geostatistical modeling techniques, and newer exposure assessment techniques will provide additional insight.},

abstract = {Now that stratospheric ozone depletion has been controlled by the Montreal Protocol, interest has turned to the effects of climate change on the ozone layer. Climate models predict an accelerated stratospheric circulation leading to changes in the spatial distribution of stratospheric ozone and an increased stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux. Here we use an atmospheric chemistry climate model to isolate the effects of climate change from those of ozone depletion and recovery on stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux and the clear-sky ultraviolet radiation index—a measure of potential human exposure to ultraviolet radiation. We show that under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change moderate emissions scenario, global stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone flux increases by 23% between 1965 and 2095 as a result of climate change. During this time, the clear-sky ultraviolet radiation index decreases by 9% in northern high latitudes—a much larger effect than that of stratospheric ozone recovery—and increases by 4% in the tropics, and by up to 20% in southern high latitudes in late spring and early summer. The latter increase in the ultraviolet index is equivalent to nearly half of that generated by the Antarctic 'ozone hole' that was created by anthropogenic halogens. Our results suggest that climate change will alter the tropospheric ozone budget and the ultraviolet index, which would have consequences for tropospheric radiative forcing, air quality and human and ecosystem health.},
