%% Background paragraph
%
Ozone in the troposphere is a toxic pollutant which causes respiratory and agricultural damage. 
The two main sources of tropospheric ozone are chemical production, and transport from the stratosphere.
Chemical production can occur following biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when they mix with polluted urban air. 
Most tropospheric ozone is formed through chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides, the hydroxyl radical, and VOCs.
Most emitted VOCs are of biogenic origin, and the primary biogenic VOC emitted to the atmosphere from land is isoprene; however, estimates of emission rates are highly uncertain.
Transport of ozone from the stratosphere is also uncertain, and difficult to measure.
These uncertainties affect atmospheric chemistry models, reducing confidence in modelled atmospheric processes such as radiative forcing and air quality forecasting. 
%Isoprene, formaldehyde, and ozone in the troposphere are linked by oxidative chemistry and are all important to air quality, climate, and radiation budgets.
%% Thesis aims:
This thesis has three aims: to quantify formaldehyde amounts over Australia observed by satellite using a global Chemistry Transport Model (GEOS-Chem), to determine Australian isoprene emissions using modelled isoprene-to-formaldehyde yields along with satellite formaldehyde amounts, and to attribute ozone in the troposphere to the contributions from chemical production and stratospheric transport. 
Model and observations are combined for each aim in this thesis.

%Jenny Comment: \textbf{I would prefer each of these 3 main paragraphs to be a super-mini version of the main chapters, with one-two sentences each for: intro/context; what you did, what you found, what makes it meaningful/important.}

%% Modelling chapter:
%
Formaldehyde measurement records from satellite instruments can be used to estimate isoprene emission rates.
Satellite formaldehyde measurements require modelled a priori vertical profiles of concentration.
Corrections are required to remove the influence of this a priori profile when comparing satellite products against models or other measurements. 
Formaldehyde measurements were recalculated in two different ways (removing the effects from the old a priori), with both recalculation technique and outcome analysed.
The method used to recalculate vertical column amounts significantly affected the outcome.
Measurements affected by anthropogenic and pyrogenic sources are filtered out using other satellite products, and then satellite pixels are gridded into a daily dataset.
These data are formed to be used with modelled isoprene-to-formaldehyde yields in order to estimate isoprene emissions.

%% Isoprene chapter
%
Isoprene is predominantly emitted by trees and shrubs, and Eucalypts are potentially very high emitters. 
Isoprene oxidises in the atmosphere to form formaldehyde, which has a sufficiently short lifetime in the atmosphere to establish chemical equilibrium.
A linear model is created using modelled isoprene emissions and formaldehyde enhancements over Australia.
This model is applied to satellite formaldehyde to create a new estimate of Australian isoprene emissions.
%Results are compared against existing measurement campaigns for validation and analysis. 
Isoprene emissions from Australian forests are found to be substantially lower than previous estimates have predicted.
This leads to an overall lowering of surface background ozone concentrations of approximately 5\%.

%% Ozone chapter
%
The second most abundant source of tropospheric ozone is the stratosphere, which occasionally mixes into the troposphere bringing ozone-rich air masses down towards the Earth's surface. 
Analysing the local weather patterns and ozone seasonality, most transport is found to occur during low pressure frontal weather systems. 
This work provides a novel technique using a mathematical (Fourier band-pass) filter on ozonesonde profiles for estimation and quantification of tropospheric ozone transported from the stratosphere. 
An estimate encompassing three measurement stations over the Southern Ocean near Australia of about $7.2 \times 10^{17}$ \moleccm ~per year is derived.

Overall, this work improves knowledge of tropospheric ozone and its sources for Australia.
