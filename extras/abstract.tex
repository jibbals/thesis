Jenny Comment: \textbf{I would prefer each of these 3 main paragraphs to be a super-mini version of the main chapters, with one-two sentences each for: intro/context; what you did, what you found, what makes it meaningful/important.}

Ozone in the troposphere is a toxic pollutant which causes respiratory and agricultural damage. 
The two main sources are chemical production, and transport from the stratosphere.
Chemical production can occur following biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) when they mix with polluted urban air. 
%Not correct as written. First, transport isn't a precursor; second you don't get O3 from BVOCs without NOx; third depending where you are anthropogenic or pyrogenic VOCs may be more important. Suggest rephrasing to say two main sources are chemical production in the troposphere and transport from the stratosphere. You can then say what precursors are involved.
Most tropospheric ozone is formed through chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides, the hydroxy radical, and volatile organic compounds (such as isoprene). 
Contributions to ozone levels in the troposphere over Australia are highly uncertain, affecting our ability to model important atmospheric processes. 
Isoprene, formaldehyde, and ozone in the troposphere are linked by oxidative chemistry and are all important to air quality, climate, and radiation budgets.
This thesis has three aims: to quantify formaldehyde amounts over Australia observed by satellite using a global CTM (GEOS-Chem), to determine Australian isoprene emissions using modelled isoprene-to-formaldehyde yields along with satellite formaldehyde amounts, and to attribute ozone in the troposphere to the contributions from chemical production and stratospheric transport. 
Model and observations are combined for each aim in this thesis.

To quantify isoprene emissions (the dominant BVOC), formaldehyde (one of the main products of isoprene oxidation) is used as a proxy. Formaldehyde observed by satellite over Australia is calculated based on modelled a priori vertical distributions using a CTM and a radiative transfer model. 
In order to compare satellite formaldehyde products against models or other measurements, corrections are required to remove the influence of the a priori profile. Impacts on formaldehyde levels from anthropogenic and pyrogenic sources are determined and filtered out to determine the biogenic footprint and minimise bias in isoprene emissions quantification.

Isoprene is predominantly emitted by trees and shrubs, and Eucalypts are potentially very high emitters. 
Subsequent oxidation reactions form formaldehyde which has a sufficiently short lifetime in the atmosphere to establish chemical equilibrium.
Using a simple linear model and assuming minimal transport and a chemical steady state allows an estimate of the yield of formaldehyde from isoprene emissions. 
This yield is modelled over Australia and then applied to the recalculated satellite formaldehyde to create a new estimate of Australian isoprene emissions. 
This technique is used to improve isoprene emissions estimates without extensive measurement campaigns.
Results are compared against existing measurement campaigns for validation and analysis. 
Isoprene emissions from Australian forests are found to be substantially lower than previous estimates have predicted.

The second most abundant source of tropospheric ozone is the stratosphere, which occasionally mixes into the troposphere bringing ozone-rich air masses down towards the earth's surface. 
Analysing the local weather patterns and ozone seasonality, most transport is found to occur during low pressure frontal weather systems. 
This work provides a novel technique using a mathematical (Fourier band-pass) filter on ozonesonde profiles for estimation and quantification of tropospheric ozone transported from the stratosphere. 
An estimate encompassing three measurement stations over the Southern Ocean near Australia of about $7.2 \times 10^{17}$ \moleccm ~per year is derived.

Overall, this work improves knowledge of tropospheric ozone and its sources for Australia.
