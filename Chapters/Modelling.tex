\section{Introduction}
  %Why use models?
  % Models
  
  In this thesis the word model is most often used to represent a chemical transport model (CTM), which simulates chemistry and chemical transport through the atmosphere.
  Models of the atmosphere can be used to interpret measurements, estimate chemical concentrations at any scale, and predict atmospheric composition in the future.
  In remote sensing measurements, modelling is required in order to produce useful outputs.
  Models of ozone in the atmosphere are used broadly for international assessments of ozone precursor emissions, and estimating effects from related processes (such as radiation) \parencite{Young2018}.
  %\textcite{Young2018} summarise current global ozone modelling standards and the metrics and processes used to evaluate these models.
  Models provide an estimate of many trace gas concentrations; however,verification is required, and generally performed using results from measurement campaigns.
  In situ measurements from campaigns or measurement stations can be used to examine what is happening at a particular location.
  These data are used to determine how accurate models or estimates are - however the utility is limited to where and when the measurements took place.
  In this thesis data from several campaigns are compared against model outputs and satellite datasets.
  %Satellite usage and reduction of uncertainty
  Satellite datasets provide large amounts of data over most of the planet.
  However, they can have high uncertainty due to instrument limitations.
  Many datapoints can be averaged in order to reduce uncertainty.
  In this chapter several satellite datasets are combined to estimate biogenic HCHO amounts over Australia.
  
  The first goal is to analyse Australia-specific HCHO concentrations measured by satellite, and determine isoprene sensitivity and any model bias.
  This leads into Chapter \ref{BioIsop} where biogenic HCHO columns are used to estimate isoprene emissions.
  The second goal is to quantify ozone transported from the stratosphere down into the troposphere (Chapter \ref{Ozone}).
  The focus in this chapter is to describe and analyse model outputs and measurements along with how they are recalculated and compared.
  Section \ref{Model:datasets} details satellite and campaign datasets, and additionally describes model outputs.
  Measurement techniques used to retrieve the most utilised satellite dataset are outlined in Section \ref{Model:omhcho}.
  Section \ref{Model:GC} describes the GEOS-Chem model, how it is run and what setup and outputs are used in this thesis.
  In Section \ref{Model:AMF} the process of using model outputs to recalculate satellite vertical columns is defined and analysed.
  In order to compare satellite data with other datasets, some work must be undertaken to avoid introducing bias \parencite[e.g.,][]{Palmer2001, Eskes2003, Marais2012, Lamsal2014}.
  One key step is to recalculate the satellite information using modelled data, detailed in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc}.
  The effects of these recalculations on satellite HCHO is also examined.
  The creation and effects of filters used to remove non-biogenic influences are described in Section \ref{Model:filter}.

\section{Datasets}
  \label{Model:datasets}
  
  This section describes the datasets used in this thesis, along with an overview of the measurement techniques used for each.
  This includes modelled output, satellite measurements, and measurement campaigns.
  These datasets serve four purposes: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Model output validation in this chapter
    \item Calculation of biogenic HCHO distribution over Australia in this chapter
    \item Recalculated OMI formaldehyde columns are used as a basis for estimating isoprene emissions in Chapter \ref{BioIsop}
    \item Extrapolation of ozone transport in Chapter \ref{Ozone}
  \end{enumerate}
  I will also give details on filtering and interpolations which are undertaken when reading data, as each dataset has its own resolution.
  While I have not made any measurements myself, it is important to understand the techniques used in datasets I have utilised in order to understand possible anomalous datapoints or trends.
  
  % Coordinate systems in use
  Horizontal geographical coordinates are always discussed in terms of degrees north and east, from -180\degr to 180\degr spanning west to east around the globe and -90\degr to 90\degr spanning the latitudes from the Antarctic to the Arctic.
  Vertical resolution is sometimes discussed in terms of metres, sometimes in terms of pressure (hPa), and sometimes in terms of sigma ($\sigma$) coordinates.
  Sigma coordinates represent the fraction of the atmosphere vertically above, with $\sigma = 1$ being the surface and $\sigma = 0$ being the top of the atmosphere (TOA).
  This can be useful when running global atmospheric models as the ground altitude is always at $\sigma=1$ and we need not worry about topography.
  Conversion between $\sigma$ and pressure (p) coordinates is as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{Model:datasets:eqn_sigma_pressure}
    \sigma = \frac{p_{S} - p}{p_{S}-p_{T}}
  \end{equation}
  where $p_{S}$ and $p_{T}$ is surface pressure and pressure at the TOA respectively.
  
  Uncertainty (or error) is present in each dataset and where possible the causes are explained.
  There are two types of error: systematic and random.
  Arguably the worst of these is systematic error (or bias).
  Bias normally indicates a problem in calculation or instrumentation.
  If the systematic error is known, it can be corrected for by either offsetting data in the opposite direction, or else fixing the cause.
  A proper fix can only be performed if the sources of error are known and there is a way of correcting or bypassing it.
  Random error is often reported as some function of a datasets variance, or uncertainty.
  It can be reduced through averaging either spatially or temporally. 
  Temporal and/or spatial averaging decreases uncertainty by a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$ where N is the number of observations being averaged.
  
  \subsection{Satellite}
  \label{Model:datasets:satellite}
    % Satellite data product levels
    Satellite data products are generally classed into several categories, level 0 through to level 3. Level 0 products are sensor counts and orbital swath data, level 1B data calibrates and geo-locates the level 0 data. 
    Level 2 products additionally have temporal, spatial, solar, and viewing geometry information, as well as quality flags.
    To create level 2 data slant column density is determined and then translated into vertical column density. 
    Level 3 data is a temporally aggregated subset of level 2 data, for instance monthly or yearly averages.
    
    % Satellites use DOAS for trace gases which we are interested in
    Satellites record near nadir (vertical) reflected spectra between around 250-700~nm split into spectral components at around $0.3$~nm in order to calculate trace gases including O$_3$, NO$_2$, and HCHO \parencite[e.g.,][]{Leue2001}.
    Satellite measurements are generally performed using spectral fitting followed by conversion to vertical column densities.
    %The use of multiple satellites can even be used to detect intradiel concentrations in trace gas columns, as shown in \textcite{Stavrakou2015} using OMI and GOME-2 measurements, which have respective overpass times of 1330 and 0930 LT.
    Several public data servers are available which include products from satellites, including NASAs Earthdata portal (\url{https://earthdata.nasa.gov/}) and the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (IASB-BIRA) Aeronomie site (\url{http://h2co.aeronomie.be/}).
    
    
    Rayleigh and Mie scattering describe two kinds of particle effects on radiation passing through a medium.
    Rayleigh scattering is heavily wavelength dependent, and is the dominant form of scattering from particles up to roughly one tenth of the wavelength of the scattered light.
    Mie scattering more generally involves larger particles, and has less wavelength dependence.
    The effects of scattering are what gives us the information about substances in the atmosphere.
    The different particles and gases in the air have measurable properties seen by remote sensing devices such as a satellite. Although instruments will be more or less sensitive to various properties depending on altitude, radiation, and other parameters \parencite[e.g.,][]{Martin2002}.
    
    Difficulties can arise when aerosols interfere with recorded spectra (e.g., clouds, smoke, dust); however,some of these can be detected and filtered out.
    Instruments including MODIS onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites are able to determine aerosol optical depth (AOD), a measure of atmospheric scatter and absorbance. 
    An AOD under 0.05 indicates a clear sky, while values of 1 or greater indicate increasingly hazy conditions.
    This is important in order to determine where measurements from other instruments may be compromised by high interference.
    Cloud filtering is performed on several satellite products used in this thesis, due to the uncertainty introduces by cloud interference. 
    This has been seen to introduce a clear-sky bias in monthly averages since measurements do not include cloudy days \parencite{Surl2018}.
    
    Satellite measured AOD requires validation by more accurate ground based instruments like those of AERONET which uses more than 200 sun photometers scattered globally.
    Soon much more satellite data will be available in the form of geostationary satellite measurements \parencite{Kwon2017}.
    %\textcite{Kwon2017} examine simulated geostationary measurements against GEOS-Chem column simulations to determine the most important instrument sensitivities.
    Geostationary satellites can provide temporally rich measurements over an area, as they are not sweeping around the earth but fixed relative to one latitude and longitude.
    
    \subsubsection{Formaldehyde}
      
      OMI spectra are used in several products used in this thesis, including OMHCHO, OMNO2d, and OMAERUVd.
      Satellite based formaldehyde measurements from the OMI instrument onboard Aura are stored in the OMHCHO product.
      OMHCHO data is used and modified extensively throughout this thesis, and so is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{Model:omhcho}.
      Calculation of column density and AMF are discussed respectively in sections \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS} and \ref{Model:omhcho:amf}.
      
      HCHO products can be found in four satellite instruments: GOME on ERS-2, SCIAMACHY on ENVI-SAT, OMI on EOS Aura, and GOME2 on MetOp-A.
      These satellites have slightly different spectral and spatial resolutions, as well as using varied processes to estimate HCHO from detected radiances.
      This leads to different estimates between instruments as described in \textcite{Lorente2017}, and both validation and comparison become more important when using these remotely sensed data.
      The data set used in this thesis is from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the Aura satellite, as it has data for the entire time line and sufficiently covers the southern hemisphere.
      
    \subsubsection{Nitrogen dioxide}
      \label{Model:datasets:OMNO2d}
      OMNO2d is a gridded daily level three NO$_2$ product with good satellite pixels averaged into 0.25x0.25$^{\circ}$ horizontally resolved bins.
      An example figure from Jan 29, 2005 is shown in Figure \ref{Model:datasets:OMNO2d:fig_eg_omno2d}, while an average for 2005 (global) is shown in Figure \ref{Model:datasets:OMNO2d:fig_omno2d_2005}.
      OMNO2 pixel resolution is 40~km by 130~km.
      NO$_2$ measured by OMI is used to check whether NO$_2$ is well represented by GEOS-Chem (see Section \ref{Model:GC:NOx} for the comparison between this product and GEOS-Chem calculations).
      It is also used to form the anthropogenic influence filter for OMHCHO (See Section \ref{Model:filter:NOx}).
      
      
      \mypic{Figures/OMNO2d_2005m0129.png}{Example of NO$_2$ tropospheric columns taken from the OMNO2d product.}{\label{Model:datasets:OMNO2d:fig_eg_omno2d}}
      
      \mypic{Figures/OMNO2d_avg2005.png}
      {Average 2005 tropospheric NO$_2$ from OMNO2d with pixels screened for $<30\%$ cloud cover.}
      {\label{Model:datasets:OMNO2d:fig_omno2d_2005}}
      
      Like other satellite products, OMNO2d is influenced by a priori modelling which is required to convert slant path radiance to vertical columns.
      These models are generally low resolution ($\sim$ 110~km by 110~km), which leads to column smearing and difficulty detecting point sources of high NO emissions \parencite{Goldberg2018}.
      Uncertainty in this product arises mostly from the calculation of the AMF (up to 50\% of total error) \parencite{Lorente2017}.
    
    \subsubsection{Aerosol optical depth}
      \label{Model:datasets:OMAERUVd}
      
      % smoke aaod outline
      Aerosols in the atmosphere can be seen through their affects on light. 
      Smoke and dust can be seen as an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD) (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS}).
      This is due these particles scattering and absorbing UV radiation \parencite{Ahn2008}.
      A data product provided by Earthdata (\url{https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMAERUVd_V003/summary}) called OMAERUVd (DOI: 10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA3003) is used in this thesis. 
      
      
      OMAERUVd provides a useful dataset which allows detection of areas which may be smoke affected.
      The product contains AOD and aerosol absorption optical depths (AAOD) at three wavelengths (354, 388, and 500~nm), along with UV aerosol index (UVAI).
      The OMAERUVd product is level three gridded daily data, based on quality filtered level two swath pixels which are then gridded by averaging.
      The product is most sensitive to error in the form of sub-pixel scale cloud interference, so I select AAOD as the basis for my smoke filter as it is least affected by clouds \parencite{Ahn2008}.
      
      % How I read the AAOD
      In this work AAOD is mapped from 1x1\degr horizontal resolution to \highhr using nearest value mapping.
      The AAOD at 500~nm wavelength is used to determine smoke influence, although any of the provided wavelengths would be affected by smoke plumes and could also be used.
      This daily AAOD is compared to a threshold to create a daily smoke filter, any areas with AAOD$>0.03$ are considered to be potentially smoke plume affected (see Section \ref{Model:filter:fire}).
    
    \subsubsection{Active fires}
      \label{Model:datasets:MOD14A1}
      MOD14A1 is a gridded daily satellite based dataset of fire counts at 1x1~km$^2$ horizontal resolution.
      Fire observations are performed four times daily from Terra (10:30~LT, 22:30~LT) and Aqua (01:30~LT, 13:30~LT).
      The fire pixels are detected based on parameters including apparent pixel temperature and the nearby background temperature.
      The dataset is obtained from NASA Earth Observations (NEO) that is part of the EOS Project Science Office at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center \url{https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MOD14A1_M_FIRE}.
      This product is downloaded and binned into a lower resolution (using the sum of fire pixels) to create an active fire influence mask (see Section \ref{Model:filter:fire}).
      
    \subsubsection{Carbon monoxide}
      \label{Model:datasets:AIRS}
      
      In Chapter \ref{Ozone}, potential biomass burning plumes are identified using satellite observations of CO from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infra-red Sounder) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite \parencite{AIRS3STD}.
      CO is used as a proxy for biomass burning plumes, and used to qualitatively attribute ozone intrusion events as explained in Section \ref{Ozone:WeatherClassifications}.
      This is a separate method of detecting fire influence near specific sites through visual analysis.
      
  
    \subsubsection{Uncertainties}
      
      %Satellite Errors
      While satellite data is effective at covering huge areas (the entire earth) it only exists at a particular time of day, is subject to cloud cover, and generally does not have fine horizontal or vertical resolution.
      Concentrations retrieved by satellites have large uncertainties, which arise in the process of transforming spectra into total column measurements, as well as instrument degradation (satellite instruments are hard to tinker with once they are launched).
      Uncertainty in transforming satellite spectra comes from a range of things, including measurement difficulties introduced by clouds, and instrument sensitivity to particular aerosols \parencite{Millet2006}.
      Many products require analysis of cloud and aerosol properties in order to estimate concentration or total column amounts \parencite{Palmer2001,Palmer2003, Marais2012, Vasilkov2017}.
      The main source of error in satellite retrievals of HCHO are due to instrument detection sensitivities, and calculation of the air mass factor (AMF) which converts slanted light path concentrations into a vertical profile \parencite{Millet2006}.
      % amf agreements between groups, but sensitive to a priori
      Calculations of the AMF performed by different groups tend to agree fairly well, as long as all the a priori and ancillary data is similar.
      Large differences can occur depending on the a priori vertical profile, trace gas concentrations, and cloud properties \parencite{Lorente2017}.
      Choice of RTM and interpolation operations have a relatively small affect compared to the assumed state of the atmosphere, with high structural uncertainty introduced at this stage of AMF calculation - as shown in \textcite{Lorente2017}.
      
      
      %% Detection limit 
      A common way of reducing satellite uncertainty is through oversampling or temporal averaging.
      This is done frequently for trace gases (which are often near to the detection limit over much of the globe).
      For example: \textcite{Vigouroux2009} reduce the measurement uncertainty (in SCIAMACHY HCHO columns) by at least a factor of 4 through averaging daily over roughly 500km around Saint-Denis, and only using days with at least 20 good measurements.
      Another example of this can be seen in \textcite{Dufour2009}, where monthly averaging is used to decrease the measurements uncertainty at the cost of temporal resolution.
      %They examine HCHO in Europe, which is low; near the detection limit of satellite measurements.
      
      %% SURFACE CONDITIONS AND CLOUDS
      In cloudy, hazy or polluted areas measurements are more difficult to analyse \parencite[e.g.,][]{Palmer2003,Marais2014}.
      Recent work by \textcite{Vasilkov2017} showed that updating how the surface reflectivity is incorporated into satellite measurements can change the retrievals by 50~\% in polluted areas.
      
      
  \subsection{Model datasets}
    
    \subsubsection{GEOS-Chem output}
      
      GEOS-Chem model output is used extensively in this thesis and is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{Model:GC}.
      Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:outputs} specifically describes the model outputs used in this thesis.
      These are generally resolved to 47 vertical levels from the ground up to 0.01~hPa, at \lowhr horizontal resolution.
    
    \subsubsection{Meteorological reanalysis}
      \label{Model:datasets:ERAI}
      
      Synoptic scale weather patterns are taken from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-I) \parencite{Dee2011}.
      These are used in Chapter \ref{Ozone} to determine typical weather systems for stratospheric ozone intrusions.
      The version used was ERA-Interim, which was the most up to date at the time (2016) but has since been superseded by ERA5.
    
    \subsubsection{Surface temperatures}
      The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) provides a product with maximum daily land-surface temperature at 0.5x0.5\degr  horizontal resolution. 
      This data is used to check the correlation between HCHO and temperature at a higher resolution than is provided by GEOS-Chem output.
      A full description of the data can be found at \url{https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.cpc.globaltemp.html}.
      CPC Global Temperature data is provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their web site at \url{https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/}.
      An example of one day of land temperature output is shown in Figure \ref{Model:datasets:fig_CPC_EG}.
      
      \mypicw{.5\textwidth}{Figures/CPC_Temperature_EG.png}{CPC daily maximum temperature dataset output for 1, Jan, 2005.}{\label{Model:datasets:fig_CPC_EG}}
  
  \subsection{Campaign datasets}
  
    In this thesis data from several measurement campaigns are used to examine accuracy of modelled data at specific sites.
    Figure \ref{Model:datasets:fig_locations} shows the locations of BVOC measurement sites in the top panel, and release sites for ozonesondes in the bottom panel.
    These took place over disparate times, and are in situ measurements which are hard to directly compare against GEOS-Chem output which is averaged over a large horizontal space.
    
    \mypic{Figures/campaigns/campaign_locations.png}{Locations of VOC measurements (top panel) and ozonesonde release sites (bottom panel). Inlaid in top panel is the flight paths over Australia of the HIPPO campaign.}{\label{Model:datasets:fig_locations}}
    
    The campaign datasets provide three separate time series for brief periods of both isoprene and formaldehyde.
    Figure \ref{Model:datasets:fig_campaigns_compared} shows these along with the detection limits and also shows isoprene measurements superimposed over a single year.
    It is apparent that more measurements are required to see more than the daily cycles.

    \subsubsection{Measurements of Urban, Marine and Biogenic Air (MUMBA)}
    \label{Model:datasets:MUMBA}
    
      The MUMBA campaign \parencite{PatonWalsh2017} measured various compound abundances including isoprene, formaldehyde, and ozone from 21 December 2012 to 15 February 2013.
      These measurements took place in Wollongong, 10~m above ground level (40~m above sea level).
      Ozone was measured by Thermo UV absorption with 1-minute time resolution averaged into hourly outputs.
      Isoprene and HCHO were measured by Ionicon Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass spectrometer (PTR-MS), with a time resolution of 3-minutes, averaged each hour.
      Detection limits varied due to instrument conditions, and are listed in Table \ref{Model:datasets:MUMBA:tab_detectionlimits}.
      The full dataset has been published on PANGAEA (DOI:10.1594/PANGAEA.871982) \parencite{Guerette2018}.
      
      
      \begin{table}
        \caption{Detection limits for MUMBA}
        \begin{tabular}{  l |  l  l  l }
          
          \textbf{Dates} & \textbf{HCHO (ppb)} & \textbf{Isoprene (ppb)} & \textbf{Ozone (ppb)}
          \\ \hline
          21/Dec/2012 - 29/Dec/2012 & 0.205 & 0.003 & 0.5 \\
          29/Dec/2012 - 18/Jan/2013 & 0.105 & 0.005 & 0.5 \\
          19/Jan/2013 - 15/Feb/2013 & 0.186 & 0.003 & 0.5 \\
        \end{tabular}
        \label{Model:datasets:MUMBA:tab_detectionlimits}
      \end{table}
      
      In this thesis we assume uncertainty in this product is as estimated by \textcite{Dunne2018} at (50\%).
      Although the uncertainty determined through calibration measurements was only 15\% \parencite{Guerette2018}, this does not account for competing trace gas interference (such as furan).
      The readings are re-sampled to hourly averages.
      Measurements below the detection limit are set to half of the detection limit when reading this dataset.
    
    \subsubsection{Sydney Particle Studies (SPS1, SPS2)}
    \label{Model:datasets:SPS}
      Two trace gas measurement campaigns took place at the Westmead air quality station. %with scientists from CSIRO, OEH, and ANSTO 
      Stage 1 (SPS1) from 5 February to 7 March, 2011 and stage 2 (SPS2) from 16 April to 14 May, 2012.
      Two instruments measured VOC concentrations: a PTR-MS, and a gas chromatographer (GC) with a flame ionisation detector (FID).
      The PTR-MS uses chemical ionisation mass spectrometry and can quantify VOCs at high temporal resolution ($< 1$~s).
      It was calibrated several times per day against HCHO, isoprene, $\alpha$-pinene, and several other VOCs, further measurement specifics can be found in \textcite{Dunne2018}.
      % Dunne 2018 looks like an analysis of VOC readings from the sites
      
      The output lists hourly averaged ppbv concentrations of trace gases based on the mass to charge ratio (m/z), which for isoprene is 69.
      % Sensitivities
      It is possible that other chemicals (such as furan, with the same m/z) interfered with this value, especially at low ambient isoprene concentrations and towards the end of autumn (SPS2) when wood fires start to become frequent \parencite{Guerette2018}.
      The GC-FID analysed samples collected in multi-absorbent tubes, with lower temporal resolution but no interference. 
      Further details for this method can be found in \textcite{Cheng2016}.
      GC-FID data is averaged from 0500-1000~LT, and 1100-1900~LT, while PTR-MS data is averaged hourly.
      This includes significant differences between measurement devices when detecting isoprene, potentially due to interfering compounds in the PTR-MS \parencite{Dunne2018}.
      
      Figure \ref{Model:datasets:SPS:fig_series} shows isoprene and formaldehyde over the course of these two campaigns, as well as the detection limits (dashed lines), as measured by PTR-MS. 
      In order to compare with GEOS-Chem output (see Section \ref{Model:GC}) a daily average and an midday time (13:00-14:00~LT) average are both created from these data.
      In averaging, any measurements below the machine detection limit are set to half of the detection limit, as done in \textcite{Lawson2015}. 
      This should minimise any introduced bias.

    \subsubsection{Ozonesondes}
    \label{Model:datasets:ozonesondes}
    
      Ozonesonde data come from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre (WOUDC).
      Ozonesondes are weather balloons which measure from the surface to around 35km.
      Ozonesondes provide a high vertical resolution profile of ozone, temperature, pressure, and humidity.
      Generally the instrument will perform 150-300 measurements in the troposphere with ozone mixing ratios quantified by an electrochemical concentration cell (\url{http://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/organize/protocols/appendix5/}).
      
      Ozonesondes are launched approximately weekly from Melbourne (38$^{\circ}$ S, 145$^{\circ}$ E), Macquarie Island (55$^{\circ}$ S, 159$^{\circ}$ E) and Davis (69$^{\circ}$ S, 78$^{\circ}$ E). 
      Melbourne, a major city with more than 4 million residents \parencite{ABS2016}, may be affected by anthropogenic pollution in the lower troposphere.
      Actual releases are north of the central business district in the Broadmeadows suburb.
      Macquarie Island is in the remote Southern Ocean and unlikely to be affected by any local pollution events.
      Davis (on the coast of Antarctica) is also unlikely to experience the effects of anthropogenic pollution.
      More information on this dataset is given in Section \ref{Ozone:DataMethods}.
    
    \subsubsection{Wollongong}
    \label{Model:datasets:wollongong_ftir}
    
      Upon the roof of the Chemistry building in Wollongong lies a solar Fourier transform infra-red spectrometer (FTIR) which measures HCHO (amongst other gases) on the path of light between the instrument and the sun.
      TODO: details about these measurements.
      
      
      Measurements of vertical profiles are affected by the instruments sensitivity to HCHO at all vertical levels, along with the a priori assumed vertical profile ($x_{apri}$).
      The averaging kernal ($A$) essentially represents how the retrieval technique is sensitive to HCHO concentrations.
      Figure \ref{Model:datasets:wollongong_ftir:fig_apriori} shows averaged retrievals $x_{ret}$ and the a priori side by side.
      Most of the HCHO is close to the surface, and generally the a priori lies within the inter-quartile range of the retrievals but lies just below the mean.
      Figure \ref{Model:datasets:wollongong_ftir:fig_MiddayAK} shows how the instrument based retrievals of total vertical column HCHO ($\Omega$) in \moleccm is sensitive to HCHO between 0~km and 60~km altitude.
      The panel on the right shows how each retrieved vertical level is sensitive to HCHO at all levels.
      This shows how there is not much sensitivity at higher altitudes, and how HCHO at lower altitudes can affect retrieved values for concentrations at higher altitudes.
      When comparing FTIR measurements to modelled data, vertical columns are used rather than profiles as the degree of freedom in each measurement is low ($\sim 1.3$ in summer to $\sim 1.7$ in winter).
      Degrees of freedom signify how many pieces of information can be retrieved from a measurement, and profiles resolved to N vertical levels would require N degrees of freedom.

      The retrieved vertical profile ($x_{ret}$) can be expressed as a linear function of the true vertical profile ($x_{true}$) and the a priori vertical profile ($x_{pri}$):
      \begin{equation}
        x_{ret} = x_{a} + A \left( x_{true} - x_{a} \right)
      \end{equation}
      One way of looking at this is to consider if the device was perfectly sensitive to HCHO concentrations at all vertical levels (making $A=I$ the identity matrix), then the retrieval would be equal to the true profile.
      If the instrument was perfectly useless (making $A=0$), then the retrieval would completely ignore the true profile and simply equal the a priori.
      To compare modelled vertical profiles ($x_{GC}$) with the FTIR, the modelled profiles are \textit{convolved} with the instrument averaging kernal and a priori to create a pseudo retrieval ($x'_{GC}$) which shows what the instrument would retrieve if the model were the truth:
      \begin{equation}
        x'_{GC} = x_{a} + A \left( x_{GC} - x_{a} \right)
      \end{equation}
      $x'_{GC}$ can be compared against $x_{ret}$ to determine if measurements and modelled vertical profiles or columns show significant differences.
      This convolution is required so as to avoid seeing a bias between the instrument and the model which is due to the instrument a priori.
      In this thesis the vertical profiles are transformed into vertical columns ($\Omega$) using the hydrostatic relationship and an assumed dry air profile (see \textcite{Deeter2002}):
      %\url{https://www.acom.ucar.edu/mopitt/avg_krnls_app.pdf})
      \begin{equation}
        \Omega = x \times 2.12 \times 10^{13} \times \Delta p
      \end{equation}
      where $\Omega$ is in \moleccm, $x$ is in ppbv, and p is the pressure in hPa between pressure midpoints for each vertical level in $x$..
      
      
    
    \subsubsection{Uncertainties}
    \label{Model:datasets:uncertainties}
      
      % Measurement difficulties
      In situ measurements contain errors, and depending on the device used and chemical being measured this error can be significant.
      The major sources of uncertainty in measurement techniques included interference from non-target compounds and under-reporting \parencite[e.g.,][]{Dunne2018,Guerette2018}.
      Overall isoprene uncertainty in measurements analysed by \textcite{Dunne2018} was a factor of 1.5 to 2.
      This can feed into uncertainties in modelling and satellite retrievals, as verification and correlations are affected.

\section{Satellite formaldehyde}
\label{Model:omhcho}
  
  % Aura satellite trace gas measurements
  One satellite product used extensively in this thesis is named OMHCHO: from NASA's Earth Observing System's ``Aura'', which provides several other useful datasets (products).
  Aura orbits the earth in a polar sun-synchronous pattern, circling the earth on a plane coincident with the sun and the poles.
  % omi instrument onboard aura
  Aura houses the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), a near-UV/Visible Charged Coupled Device (CCD) spectrometer.
  The OMI instrument onboard Aura has been active since July 2005, it records spectra from 264-504~nm using an array of 60 detectors with mid-resolution (0.4-0.6~nm).
  This band of wavelengths allows measurements of trace gases (among other quantities) and the formaldehyde product is detailed here.
  
  
  From here on the word pixel is used to describe one data point retrieved by OMI, each pixel includes a latitude and longitude within OMI's data product.
  Figure \ref{LR:HCHO:Sat:fig_Shenkeveld_OMI_summary} shows the details of OMI's detector array and measurement resolutions.
  OMI measures atmospheric trace gases including NO$_2$, SO$_2$, BrO, HCHO, O$_3$, and aerosols.
  OMI measurements occur from right to left on a band covering 115$^{\circ}$, resulting in swaths of around 2600~km, with pixel sizes from 13x24~km$^2$ at nadir to 26x135~km$^2$ at the swath edges \parencite{Abad2015}.
  The swaths cover Earth daily, both on the light and dark side of the planet, only daytime measurements provide useful near-UV/Visible information.
  While satellite measurements can only be used during daytime hours, HCHO lifetimes are sufficiently short that any night-time chemistry will not affect midday observations \parencite{Wolfe2016}.

      The table shows the optical properties for OMIs three channels.}
    \label{LR:HCHO:Sat:fig_Shenkeveld_OMI_summary}
  \end{figure}
  
  % How omi gets its AMF
  The latest OMHCHO algorithm uses a shape factor determined from GEOS-Chem using 47 vertical levels at monthly temporal resolution and \lowhr latitude by longitude horizontal resolution \parencite{Abad2015}.
  The GEOS-Chem model has been substantially updated since then
  In this thesis the more recent version $V10.01$ is used to recalculate the vertical column HCHO (details are shown in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc}).
  
  OMI uses a Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) based technique to read HCHO along the path of light which reaches the satellite instrument.
  The first step is to determine how much HCHO is in the path of light between the sun and detector.
  Measurements done using DOAS often apply a forward radiative transfer model (RTM) such as LIDORT (see Section \ref{Model:Meas:sat:LIDORT}) in order to determine a trace gas' radiative properties at various altitudes.
  The forward RTM used for satellite data products also involve functions representing extinction from Mie and Rayleigh scattering, and the effect of these on spectra.
  These RTM are also required to account for (often estimated) atmospheric parameters such as albedo.
  The next step is to transform the calculated amounts along the non-vertical light path into vertical column amounts.
  This is done by applying an AMF.
  In the absence of atmospheric scattering a simple geometric AMF can be defined as a function of the solar zenith angle. 
  The solar zenith angle ($\theta_s$) and the satellite viewing angle ($\theta_v$) are shown in image \ref{ch_HCHO:fig:zenithangle}.
  However, in the UV-VIS region of the spectrum, Rayleigh and Mie scattering (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS}) must be accounted for.
  
  
  \begin{figure}\begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/ZenithAngles.png}
      \caption{Solar and viewing zenith angles, image copied from \textcite{SZA_Image}, originally from a NASA website.}
      \label{ch_HCHO:fig:zenithangle}
    \end{center}\end{figure}
  
  % How omhcho is produced
  Atmospheric HCHO detected by satellite requires that other trace gases with similar features near the HCHO affected wavelengths are accounted for.
  A DOAS fit determines the total column amount of a trace gas along the path that the instrument views.
  This uses the Beer-Lambert law where radiance is reduced as light travels through a medium.
  I use the NASA OMHCHOv003 data product \parencite{Abad2015}, with HCHO determined using the spectral window $328.5$~nm$ - 356.5$~nm. 
  The algorithm used is based on direct fitting of radiances, and accounts for competing absorbers, under-sampling, and Ring effects.
  An OMI radiance measurement over the remote Pacific ocean is used instead of an irradiance measurement.
  This means that the slant columns ($\Os$) are formed from the spectra differential with respect to the radiance reference column over the Pacific.
  The full method details for slant column retrieval by OMI are outlined in supplemental Section \ref{SuppNotes:Satellite:OMI_BOAS}, or in the technical document (DOI: 10.5067/Aura/OMI/DATA2015).
  Slant columns range from $\sim 4\times 10^{15} $ to $\sim 6 \times 10^{16}$~molec cm$^{-2}$, with uncertainties from 30\% (larger columns) to over 100\% (smaller columns) \parencite{Abad2015}.
  
  \subsection{Pixel filtering}
  \label{Model:omhcho:pixel_filtering}
  
    % What the swathes look like
    This thesis uses the level 2 product swath output from the NASA earth data web portal.
    OMHCHO level two data includes 14-15 daily swaths of measurements.
    Each swath contains roughly $9 \times 10^4$ pixels, each of which includes latitude, longitude vertical column HCHO, along with all the ancillary data required to make the vertical column and several data quality metrics.
    The OMHCHO dataset has a quality flag which can be used to remove unlikely or poor satellite measurements.
    The states represented by this quality flag are shown in Table \ref{Model:datasets:OMHCHO:tab_qflag} which is reproduced here (originally from \textcite{Kurosu2014}).
    First all \textit{good} pixels (those with QA flag equal to 0) are read into a long list (roughly 1 million per day).
    These are then filtered by solar zenith angle (SZA) and latitude, similarly to other works \parencite[e.g.,]{Marais2012, Barkley2013, Bauwens2016, Zhu2016}.
    Pixels with cloud fraction greater than 40\% are removed after being used in determining the reference sector correction, as is performed in \textcite{Abad2015, DeSmedt2015}.
    Filtering bad or missing measurement pixels is performed prior to any other filtering, this includes the datapoints affected by the row anomaly through a particular flag (see \url{https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/atmosphere/Instruments/OMI/PGEReleases/READMEs/OMHCHO_README_v3.0.pdf}).
    This anomaly affects radiance data at particular viewing angles, corresponding to a row on the CCD detectors, and is dynamic over time \parencite{Huang2018}.
    The slant columns affected are flagged and removed before any further processing.
    
    \begin{table}
      \caption{OMI quality flag values table from \textcite{Kurosu2014}}
      \begin{tabular}{  l  l  p{10cm} }
        \hline
        \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Classification} & \textbf{Rational} 
        \\ \hline
        0 & Good & Column value present and passes all quality checks; data may be used with confidence. 
        \\ \hline
        1 & Suspect & Caution advised because one or more of the following conditions are present: 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Fit convergence flag is $<$ 300 but $>$ 0: Convergence at noise level
          \item Column $+ 2 \sigma$ uncertainty $<$ 0 $<$ Column $ + 3 \sigma $ uncertainty
          \item Absolute column value $>$ Maximum column amount (1e19 molec cm$^{-2}$)
        \end{itemize}
        \\ \hline
        2 & Bad & Avoid using as one of the following conditions are present: 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Fit convergence flag is $<$ 0 : No convergence, abnormal termination
          \item Column $+ 3 \sigma$ uncertainty $<$ 0
        \end{itemize}
        \\ \hline
        $<0$ & Missing & No column values have been computed; entries are missing
        \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \label{Model:datasets:OMHCHO:tab_qflag}
    \end{table}
    
    Each $\sim90$ minutes the Aura satellite sweeps over the sunny side of the planet of which around 50~k -- 80~k of the roughly 90~k pixels are classified as good.
    Each pixel contains several important pieces of data which are needed for recalculation of the HCHO vertical column: the total column of HCHO ($\Omega$; \moleccm), cloud fraction, associated shape factor, AMF, geometric AMF, scattering weights and their vertical altitudes (hPa), viewing zenith angle, solar zenith angle, latitude, longitude, OMI sensor track, main data quality flag, cross track flag, and total column uncertainty.
    All of these data are needed in order to reconstruct the total vertical column using a modelled a priori shape factor rather than NASA's included a priori shape factor.
    Each pixel includes an estimate of the cloud fraction created using the OMI cloud product OMCLDO2.
    If greater than 40\% of a pixel measurement is cloudy (ie. cloud fraction $>0.4$) then the pixel is removed from subsequent analysis.
    This removes around 30\% of the pixels which remain after filtering out the bad or missing data.
    % Actual filtering done
    Satellite measurements pole-wards of 60\degr north or south are removed as well as measurements with SZA greater than 60\degr.
    Measurements taken with high SZA are unlikely to have much information from closer to the ground, and often have high uncertainty.
    
    
    Due to noise and the differential measurement technique, small negative columns are present in the satellite product which are not removed so as not to introduce a bias.
    However, some very large negative values which represent an unflagged error in the retrieval process are removed.
    Unlikely high positive measurements are also removed, leaving only measurements within the density range $-0.5 \times 10^{16}$ to $1 \times 10^{17} $\moleccm, as is performed by \textcite{Zhu2016}.
    This filter is required due to currently unexplained large negative values which occur in the OMI HCHO product increasingly over time.
    Figure \ref{Model:omhcho:pixel_filtering:fig_OMI_negative_hist} shows how unfiltered HCHO columns are affected by a small set of highly negative values which heavily affect the mean column amount over any region.
    The highly negative values can be seen around the $-10^{19}$~molecules cm$^{-2}$ region.

  \subsection{DOAS}
    \label{Model:omhcho:DOAS}
    
    The DOAS technique uses solar radiation absorption spectra to measure trace gases through paths of light.
    % Beer lambert
    Beer's law states
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_beerslaw}
    T = I/I_0 = e^{-\tau}
    \end{equation}
    with T being transmittance, $\tau$ being optical depth, and I, I$_0$ being radiant flux received at instrument and emitted at source respectively.
    The Beer-Lambert law of extinction allows spectroscopic measurement of absorbing chemical species (absorbers) in the atmosphere:
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_backscatterextinction}
    I_B = I_{B_0} e^{-\tau_s}
    \end{equation}
    where I$_B$, I$_{B_0}$ is backscattered intensity with and without the absorber respectively, and $\tau_s$ is the optical thickness of the absorber along the measured path between source and instrument.
    
    $\tau$ can be described using the scattering and absorption cross section area ($\alpha$, cm$^{2}$) and density ($\eta$, molec cm$^{-3}$) of an absorber as follows:
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_tau}
    \tau = \int \alpha(s) \eta(s) \mathrm{d}s
    \end{equation}
    $\tau$ through a medium is the sum of optical thicknesses of each absorber within the measured path (s)
    substituting Equation \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_tau} into Equation \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_backscatterextinction} leads to
    \begin{equation*}
      I = I_0 \exp { \left( \Sigma_i \int \eta_i \alpha_i ds \right) }
    \end{equation*}
    Where \textit{i} represents a chemical species index, and the integral over ds represents integration over the path from light source to instrument.
    
    % Optical depth through the atmosphere
    Another way of describing optical depth (also called optical thickness) is the natural logarithm of the ratio of incident radiant power to transmitted radiant power through a material (from Equation \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_backscatterextinction}).
    In the atmosphere we are interested in the optical depth of various chemical species, and we use incoming solar radiation to determine this.
    The difference between solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere and the earth's surface defines the atmospheric optical depth along the path of observation.
    \begin{equation*}
      \tau = \ln{\frac{\phi_e^i}{\phi_e^t}}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\phi_e^i$ is radiant flux seen at the earth surface, $\phi_e^t$ is the solar radiant flux which arrives at the top of the atmosphere.
    In the atmosphere, optical depth can be due to several factors including scattering, chemical absorbance, and aerosols.
  
  \subsection{Air mass factor (AMF)}
  \label{Model:omhcho:amf}
    % what satellite amfs are, and what they do
    To convert the trace gas profile from a reflected solar radiance column (slanted along the light path) into a purely vertical column requires calculations of an air mass factor (AMF).
    In satellite data, the AMF is typically a scalar value for each horizontal grid point which will equal the ratio of the total vertical column density to the total slant column density.
    This value requires calculations to account for instrument sensitivities to various wavelengths over resolved altitudes, and is unique for each trace gas under consideration.
    An AMF characterises measurement sensitivity to a trace gas at various altitudes \cite[e.g.,]{Palmer2001}.
    \textcite{Lorente2017} show that AMF calculations can be the largest source of uncertainty in satellite measurements.
    Another way of describing AMFs are as measures of how radiance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) changes with trace gas optical depths at specific altitudes \parencite{Lorente2017}.
    Calculation of the AMF is important as it is multiplied against the estimated slant columns in order to give vertical column amounts.
    
    %how do we get an AMF?
    DOAS column retrievals are an integration of a trace gas over the instruments viewing path, in order to convert this total to a vertically distributed column a few assumptions and estimates are required. 
    The vertical profile of a trace gas is assumed or estimated via a CTM, while its scattering and radiative properties are calculated at prescribed altitudes using an RTM. 
    These properties are combined into a single array called the AMF.
    Two examples of this are GOME-2 (on the MetOp-A satellite) products (\url{http://atmos.caf.dlr.de/gome/product_hcho.html}), and OMI products which respectively use LIDORT combined with IMAGESv2 and GEOS-Chem for processing \parencite{Chance2002, Abad2015}.
    AMFs are unique to each trace gas and due to their complexity and the influence of cloud cover they remain one of the largest error sources in remote sensing of BVOCs \parencite{Palmer2001,Millet2006}).
    \textcite{Lamsal2014} recommends that when comparing satellite data to models, the AMF should first be recalculated using the model as an a priori.
    This is in order to remove any a priori bias between model and satellite columns.
    
    % averaging kernal relation to amf, why amfs are important when comparing data
    Related to the AMF is the averaging kernal (AK), which is used to handle instrument measurements which are sensitive to gas concentrations at different altitudes through the atmosphere.
    DOAS methods can be heavily influenced by the initial estimates of a trace gas profile (the a priori) which is often produced by modelling, so when comparing models of these trace gases to satellite measurements extra care needs to be taken to avoid introducing bias from differing a priori assumptions.
    One way to remove these a priori influences is through the satellite AK (or AMF), which takes into account the vertical profile of the modelled trace gas and instrument sensitivity to the trace gas \parencite{Eskes2003, Palmer2001}.
    This process is called deconvolution ($\Omega = AK \times VC_{satellite} + \times (I - AK) VC_{a priori}$) of the AK of the satellite instrument.
    The AK represents sensitivities to each species at multiple altitudes through the atmosphere and in the case of OMI, can be approximated from the scattering weights ($\omega(z)$) function as follows:
    \begin{equation} \label{ch_HCHO:eqn:AKfromw}
    AK(z) = \frac{\omega(z)}{AMF}
    \end{equation}
    This is an approximation for the OMI product, which does not include the AK but does include the $\omega$ and AMF, as explained in \textcite{Abad2015}.
  
  \subsection{LIDORT}
    \label{Model:Meas:sat:LIDORT}
    
    %http://www.rtslidort.com/about_publications.html
    LIDORT is a model of LInearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer, used to determine backscatter intensities and weighting functions at arbitrary elevation angles \parencite{Spurr2001}.
    The model solves radiative transfer equations and can be used to determine various atmospheric column measurement attributes such as optical depth, ring effects, and scattering.
    These radiative properties (or at least estimates thereof) are required when measuring trace gases in the atmosphere through a long path such as seen by satellites \parencite[e.g.,][]{Palmer2001,Martin2002a,DeSmedt2015,Abad2015}.
  
  \subsection{Uncertainty}
    Uncertainty in a single pixel for OMHCHO is roughly the same magnitude as HCHO background levels.
    Each pixel has $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$\moleccm uncertainty, which is $5 \times$ higher than GOME.
    However, there are $\sim 100-200 \times $ as many measurements allowing a greater reduction of uncertainty with averaging.
    This is due to the smaller footprint and better temporal resolution of OMI \parencite{Chance2002,Millet2008}.
    % Uncertainty in OMI pixels measurements
    The finer nadir resolution of OMI (13 by 24~km${^2}$) compared to other satellites also reduces cloud influence \parencite{Millet2006, Millet2008}.
    The top row in Figure \ref{Model:Meas:sat:fig_OMI_uncertainty} shows OMI HCHO columns binned to at \highhr longitude by latitude averaged over one day and one month (with and without filtering).
    Row two shows uncertainty of the satellite data after averaging.
    It is clear that one day of satellite data is too uncertain when binned at \highhr horizontal resolution; however,after a month (with or without filtering) the uncertainties become manageable.
    If we assume the uncertainty is random error, and not bias introduced through calculation techniques, then we are able to reduce the uncertainty through averaging.
    High resolution low detection limit estimates can be built up using ``oversampling'', which averages satellite measurements over time \parencite[e.g.,][]{Zhu2014}.
    Uncertainty in satellite recalculations, along with other factors is analysed in Section \ref{BioIsop:Uncertainty}.
    %A good example can be seen in \textcite{Zhu2014} where 0.2$^{\circ}$ by 0.2$^{\circ}$ resolution with high enough sensitivity to see anthropogenic HCHO is acheived with three summers worth of satellite data.

Bottom row shows the uncertainty for each grid square after averaging.}{\label{Model:Meas:sat:fig_OMI_uncertainty}}
    
    In this thesis, HCHO columns (pixels) with cloud fractions over 40\% are filtered as done in \textcite{Palmer2001}, which introduces a clear-sky bias to any monthly averages.
    This is due to HCHO being lower on unrecorded cloudy days.
    This bias has been measured as a 13\% positive monthly mean bias \parencite{Palmer2001, Surl2018}.
    
    
    % Row anomaly
    Recently \textcite{Schenkeveld2017} analysed the performance over time of the instrument and found irradiance degradation of 3-8\%, changed radiances of 1-2\%, and a stable wavelength calibration within 0.005-0.020~nm.
    These changes are measured excluding the row anomaly (RA) effect, which is relatively stable since 2011, although it is still growing and remains the most serious concern.
    Their analysis of OMI concludes that data is still of high quality and will deliver useful information for 5-10 more years, with radiance only changing by $1-2\%$ outside of RA impacted areas.
    An analysis of the row anomaly by \textcite{Huang2018} state that measurements remain suitable for scientific use, with recommendation for further evaluation.
    % they were talking about ozone columns...
    The RA began in June 2007, with some cross-track rows seemingly blocked. 
    The most likely cause is some instrument insulation partially obscuring the radiance port \parencite{Schenkeveld2017}.
    
    %% BACKGROUND MEASUREMENTS
    In satellite HCHO products, concentrations over the remote Pacific ocean are sometimes used to analyse faulty instrument readings.
    This is due to the expected invariance of HCHO over this region.
    For instance GOME (an instrument which measures trace gases onboard the ERS-2) corrects for an instrument artefact using modelled HCHO over the remote Pacific \parencite{Shim2005}.
    OMI HCHO products use a similar technique to account for sensor plate drift and changing bromine sensitivity \parencite{Abad2015}.
    Uncertainty in the OMI satellite instrument is calculated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) group using the uncertainty in backscattered radiation retrievals \parencite{Abad2015, Abad2016}.
    Another method of calculating the uncertainty is used by the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA) group, who determine uncertainty from the standard deviation of HCHO over the remote Pacific ocean \parencite{DeSmedt2012, DeSmedt2015}.
    
    %% LOW BIAS IN SATELLITE HCHO EXAMPLES
    For many places the tropospheric column HCHO measured by satellite is biased low, \textcite{Zhu2016} examine six available datasets and show a bias of 20 - 51\% over south east USA when compared against a campaign of aircraft observations (SEAC$^4$RS).
    \textcite{DeSmedt2015} also found OMI and GOME2 observations were 20 - 40\% lower than ground based vertical profiles, and \textcite{Barkley2013} determine OMI to be 37\% low compared with aircraft measurements over Guyana.
    These bias can be corrected by improving the assumed a priori HCHO profiles which are used to calculate the AMFs of the satellite columns.
    \textcite{Millet2006} examine OMI HCHO columns over North America and determine overall uncertainty to be 40\%, with most of this coming from cloud interference.
    \textcite{Millet2008} shows that there also exists some latitude based bias, as well as a systematic offset between the OMI and GOME instruments.
    This does not appear to be due to the different overpass times of the two instruments.
    
    %A full analysis of the AMF uncertainty in OMI measurements, as well as the structural uncertainty (between different systems of calculations applied to the same data) is performed by \textcite{Lorente2017}.
    AMF calculation often dominates the total uncertainty in satellite retrievals, especially in polluted regions \parencite{Lorente2017}.
    In scenarios where the gas is enhanced in the lower troposphere, AMF calculation is the largest uncertainty in satellite measurements.
    In polluted environments the structural uncertainty is estimated at 42~\%, or 31~\% over unpolluted environments \parencite{Lorente2017}.
    Another impact often not included in uncertainty calculations is the structural uncertainty of retrieval methods.
    The structural uncertainty of AMF calculation approaches used by different retrieval groups comes from how the AMF is calculated, rather than uncertainty in the calculation components.
    The importance of a priori and ancillary data (such as surface albedo and cloud top height) sharply affects the structural uncertainty \parencite{Lorente2017}.
    
\section{GEOS-Chem}
  \label{Model:GC}

  \subsection{Overview}
    % Geos chem is a box model with chemistry and meteorology
    GEOS-Chem is a well supported global, Eulerian CTM (see Section \ref{LR:Models:ctm}) with a state of the science chemical mechanism, with transport driven by meteorological input from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) of the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO).
    Chemistry, transport, and meteorology are simulated at 15 minute time steps within a global set of 3-D boxes.
    Emissions are either prescribed by inventories or modelled (e.g., fire emissions are pulled from the global fire emissions database GFED4).
    % It uses GEOS, from GMAO
    
    % This thesis uses 10.01 at 2x2.5 model output
    GEOS-Chem simulates more than 100 chemical species from the earth's surface up to the edge of space (0.01~hPa) and can be used in combination with remote and in situ sensing data to give a verifiable estimate of atmospheric gases and aerosols.
    It was developed, and is maintained, by Harvard University staff as well as users and researchers worldwide.
    In this thesis I use version 10.01 of GEOS-Chem, which outputs up to 66 chemical species (tracers) in the standard run, at \lowhr horizontal resolution, with 47 levels up to the top of the atmosphere (TOA at 0.01~hPa).
    
    
    Global CTMs are often run using one or several emission models (or the output from them) to determine boundary conditions.
    Some of the inventories used by GEOS-Chem are described here.
    Meteorological fields are taken from NASA's GEOS-5 dataset (0.5\degr x 0.666\degr) \parencite{Chen2009}, which exists up to April 2013.
    GEOS-5 meteorological fields are used as the boundary conditions driving transport.
    % Emissions models used for boundary conditions
    Fire emissions come from the global fire emissions database (GFED4) product \parencite{Giglio2013}. 
    Anthropogenic VOC emissions come from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory, while biogenic VOC emissions are simulated using the MEGAN model (see Section \ref{Model:GC:MEGAN}).
    MEGAN is used to determine biogenic emissions for our default GEOS-Chem simulation.
    The estimated biogenic VOC emissions are important for accurately simulating chemistry within models, as discussed in Section \ref{LR:Atmos:Chem}.
    
  
  \subsection{Installing and running GEOS-Chem}
    \label{Model:GC:running}
    GEOS-Chem instructions for download, compilation, and running can be found in the user guide provided by Harvard: \url{http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/doc/man/}.
    In order to build and run GEOS-Chem a high-speed computing system is optimal, as globally gridded chemical calculations can take a long time to perform (for us $\sim 70$ computation hours per month).
    I installed GEOS-Chem onto a suitably configured workspace on the Raijin supercomputer at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI, \url{http://nci.org.au/}).
    This workspace included access to compilers and libraries which are needed to build the Fortran based GEOS-Chem source code, and IDL, Python, and various editors and scripting languages to read, run, edit, and analyse both GEOS-Chem and its output.
    After downloading GEOS-Chem, the code can be compiled with different options for resolution and chemical mechanisms.
  
  \subsection{Chemical Mechanism}
    \label{Model:GC:mechanisms}
    A chemical mechanism is a closed system of chemical reactions and their associated rate constants.
    Chemical reactions are represented by systems of differential equations to be solved for each gridbox in GEOS-Chem.
    Simplifications are required due to the large number of reactions which occur in the atmosphere, and the coupled and stiff nature of these reactions which slow down computation of the solutions \parencite{BrasseurJacob2017}.
    Stiffness in chemical systems of differential equations is due to the massively differing reaction time scales - for instance hydroxyl radicals react within seconds while methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 8-10 years \parencite{Wuebbles2002}. 
    
    Some of the important reactions involving isoprene are reproduced here, including reaction rates ($k$) in the form $ k = A \exp{-E/RT}$, where T is temperature, E is activation energy, and R is the gas constant, $A$, $E$, and $R$ are predefined for each reaction.
    Equation \ref{Model:GC:mechanisms:eqn_mechanisms} lists the main isoprene and sundry reactions, with terms defined in \ref{Model:GC:mechanisms:tab_species}.
    LISOPOH is added in order to allow the model to keep track of how much isoprene is oxidised by OH.
    The mechanisms used in version 10.01 (and its history) are described online at \url{http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/NOx-Ox-HC-Aer-Br_chemistry_mechanism}.

  \subsection{GEOS-Chem isoprene}
    \label{Model:GC:Isop}
    
    % outline of papers making up isoprene mechanisms
    The isoprene reactions simulated by GEOS-Chem were originally based on \textcite{Horowitz1998}.
    %This involved simulating NO$_X$, O$_3$, and NMHC chemistry in the troposphere at continental scale in three dimensions, with detailed (for 1998) NMHC chemistry with isoprene reactions and products.
    The mechanism was subsequently updated by \textcite{Mao2013}, who changed the isoprene nitrate yields and added products based on \textcite{Paulot2009a, Paulot2009b}.
    %They used anion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) to determine products of isoprene photooxidation.
    They used the yields and reactions of various positional isomers of isoprene nitrates, and their oxidation products. %, within GEOS-Chem's suite of chemical mechanisms.
    Further mechanistic properties, like isomerisation rates, are based on results from four publications: \textcite{Peeters2009, Peeters2010, Crounse2011, Crounse2012}.    
    % Peeters looks at OH adduction and subsequent pathways to reform OH with ~ 80% efficiency overall
    % hpald: hydroperoxyenal, hydroperoxyaldehyde, hydroperoxy-methyl-butenals
    
    In a chamber with clean air and high NO concentrations, isoprene photooxidation is initially driven by OH addition, followed by NO$_X$ chemistry (150~min - 600~min), and finally HO$_X$ dominated chemistry.
    Formation of isoprene nitrates (ISOPN) affect ozone levels through NO$_X$ sequestration, the yields and fate of these nitrates was analysed in \textcite{Paulot2009a}.
    %% ISOPN can be oxidised (by OH) to form nitrated organic products \parencite{Paulot2009a}.
    Prior to 2012, oxidation chamber studies were performed in high NO or HO$_2$ concentrations, giving peroxy lifetimes of less than 0.1~s \parencite{Crounse2012, Wolfe2012}.
    In most environments NO and HO$_2$ concentrations are not so high, GEOS-Chem uses production rates for different NO concentrations and peroxy radical lifetimes determined by \textcite{Crounse2012}.
    
    \subsubsection{Oxidation}
    
      % roo production, rate and cites
      \textcite{Crounse2011} examined the isomerisations associated with the oxidation of isoprene to six different isomers of \roo formed in the presence of oxygen.
      The primary oxidation pathway of isoprene is reaction with the OH radical ($ ISOP + OH \to RIO_2 $) shown in Equation \ref{mech1}.
      Isoprene undergoes OH addition at the 1 and 4 positions, becoming $\beta$ (71\%) or $\delta$ (29\%) \roo, although these are not distinguished in the GEOS-Chem mechanism. 
      Secondary oxidative pathways are from ozonolysis (Equation \ref{mech2} and reaction with NO$_3$ (Equation \ref{mech3}).
      These pathways are much slower but can be important in particular scenarios such as inside a pollution plume or at night when NO$_3$ radicals can build up.
    
      Following isoprene oxidation, seven potential \roo reactions (RIO2 in Equation \ref{Model:GC:mechanisms:eqn_mechanisms}), can occur depending on reactant concentrations and local temperature.
      \textcite{Crounse2011} determined rates and uncertainties involved in these reactions, and studied the rate of formation of C$_5$-hydroperoxyenals (C5-HPALD) by isomerisation.
      Reactions \ref{mech4} - \ref{mech10} compete to determine the fate of \roo, which is often grouped into high or low NO$_X$ concentration pathways.
      
    
    \subsubsection{Nitrogen oxide impacts}
    
      GEOS-Chem reactions account for high and low NO$_X$ scenarios as determined in \textcite{Mao2013}, based on \textcite{Paulot2009a}.
      High NO$_X$ has been defined as conditions where NO reactions are the main cause of losses for \roo (Reaction \ref{mech5}) \parencite{Palmer2003}.
      High NO$_X$ concentrations are roughly 1~ppb, while low NO$_X$ concentrations are around 0.1~ppb.
      
      % Low nox mechanism pathways
      In low NO$_X$ \roo losses occur from isomerisation or reaction with several potential compounds.
      NO$_X$ + HO$_2$ (Reaction \ref{mech6}) produces mostly hydroxy hydroperoxides (ISOPOOH), and some HCHO.
      ISOPOOH can be oxidised (by OH) to produce epoxydiols, recycling OH \parencite{Paulot2009b}. 
      %($70\%$ yield of hydroxy hydroperoxides, ISOPOOH), 
      Isomerisation of \roo (Reaction \ref{mech4}) largely produces HCHO, while recycling OH and producing HO$_2$.
      This isomerisation accounts for 1,5-H shifts producing MACR, MVK, HCHO, or 1,6-H shifts producing HPALDs.
      HPALDs can photolyse to regenerate OH and small VOCs \parencite{Crounse2011,Wolfe2012, Peeters2014}.
      Under low NO$_X$ conditions the expected production of HCHO, MVK, and MACR is 4.7\%, 7.3\%, and 12\% respectively.
      Refer to Section \ref{LR:VOCs:IsopCascade} for more information.
      Less frequently, \roo reacts with itself, MO$_2$, or MCO$_3$.
      
      % High nox chemistry
      Under high NO$_X$ conditions, the fate of \roo differs depending on how it was formed.
      The $\beta$-hydroxyl reacts with NO$_X$ and produces HCHO (66\%), methylvinylketone (40\%) (MVK), methacrolein (26\%), and $\beta$-hydroxyl nitrates (6.7\%) (ISOPNB).
      The $\delta$-hydroxyl reacts with NO to form $\delta$-hydroxyl nitrates (24\%) (ISOPND), and ISOPNB (6.7\%).
      These two pathways are combined in Reaction \ref{mech5}, which shows the production from \roo and NO.
      
      
    \subsubsection{OH}
    
      Until recently, models struggled to represent OH in the atmosphere, due to missing chemistry and issues in measurement techniques.
      Prior to \textcite{Mao2012}, measurements of OH in high VOC regions may have been up to double the real atmospheric OH levels, due to formation of OH inside the instrument.
      OH regeneration through photolysis of HPALDs in areas with high isoprene emissions are included from \textcite{Peeters2010}.
      Photolysis of photolabile peroxy-acid-aldehydes generates OH, improving model agreement with continental observations.
      OH and HPALD interactions are central to maintaining the OH levels in pristine and moderately polluted environments, which makes isoprene both a source and sink of OH \parencite{Peeters2010,Taraborrelli2012}.
      Isoprene chemistry in GEOS-Chem includes OH regeneration from oxidation of epoxydiols (not shown in Equation \ref{Model:GC:mechanisms:eqn_mechanisms}) and slow isomerisation of \roo (Equation \ref{mech4}) \parencite{Mao2013}.
      This regeneration dealt with the problem seen in older models where ISOPOOH production titrated OH, which was not backed up by measurements \parencite{Paulot2009b,Mao2013}.
      \textcite{Mao2013} showed that drastically lowering (by a factor of 50) the rate constant for \roo isomerisation lead to better organic nitrate agreements with measurements.% (ICARTT).
      These chemical updates led to more accurate modelling of OH concentrations, especially in low NO$_X$ conditions common in remote forests.
      The updates to isoprene chemistry by \textcite{Mao2013}, and those shown in \textcite{Crounse2011,Crounse2012} are the last before GEOS-Chem version 11.

  
  \subsection{Emissions from MEGAN}
    \label{Model:GC:MEGAN}
    
    % General description of MEGAN?
    
    GEOS-Chem runs the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) to determine biogenic emissions globally.
    GEOS-Chem V10.01 uses MEGAN V2.1 with biogenic emissions from \textcite{Guenther2012}.
    MEGAN is itself a global model with resolution of around 1~km, which uses globally estimated or measured (including remote sensed satellite data) inventories of parameters to estimate emissions.
    MEGAN uses leaf area index (LAI), global meteorological data, plant functional types (PFT), and photosynthetic photon flux density to simulate terrestrial isoprene emissions \parencite{Kefauver2014}.
    The schematic for MEGAN, from \url{http://lar.wsu.edu/megan/}, is shown in Figure \ref{Model:GC:Isop:MEGAN:fig_megan_schematic}.
    %\textcite{Megan_Website}
    
    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/MEGANmodel_img.jpg}
      \caption{MEGAN schematic, from \url{http://lar.wsu.edu/megan/}}
      %\textcite{Megan_Website}}
      \label{Model:GC:Isop:MEGAN:fig_megan_schematic}
    \end{figure}
    
    MEGAN was developed as a replacement for two earlier canopy-environment emission models (the biogenic emission inventory system, and the global emissions initiative), initially including a simple canopy radiative transfer model which parameterised sun-lit and shaded conditions through a canopy.
    Early models did not account for abiotic stresses, such as drought, prior rainfall and land use changes. 
    These stresses influence species-specific emissions by more than an order of magnitude \parencite{Niinemets1999}.
    Isoprene emissions were based on temperature, leaf area, and light, but have since been updated to include leaf age activity \parencite{Guenther2000}, and a leaf energy balance model \parencite{Guenther2006} in MEGANv2.0.
    This update included a parameter for soil moisture, to account for drought conditions; however,this parameter is currently (as of version 2.1) not applied to isoprene \parencite{Sindelarova2014}.
    %Soil moisture effects on isoprene emission are important, and can affect estimates.
    Instructions to run version 2.1 are available at \url{http://lar.wsu.edu/megan/docs/MEGAN2.1_User_GuideWSU.pdf}.
    %, and a version using the Community Land Model (CLM) is available at \url{http://www.cesm.ucar.edu}.
    %It uses meteorological fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modelling system.
    Version 2.1 (updated from 2.0 \parencite{Guenther2006}) includes 147 species, in 19 BVOC classes, which can be lumped together to provide appropriate output for mechanisms in various chemical models.
    GEOS-Chem uses an embedded version of MEGAN 2.1.
    
    GEOS-Chem computes some emissions using predefined emission factor ($\epsilon$) maps from MEGAN source code, and others using PFT maps and associated emission factors.
    For isoprene (the focus in this thesis) MEGAN calculates emissions online, using local meteorological conditions.
    % I think this is the case as MEGAN extension is set to ON for isop in HEMCO_Config.rc
    Emissions $E$ of species $i$ are calculated using these EF for classes of plant types $j$ and associated grid-box coverage $\xi$ and an activity factor $\gamma$ which accounts for response to environmental conditions.
    The following equation is reproduced from \textcite{Guenther2012} showing how $E_i$ are determined in MEGAN: 
    %% PFT, LAI, and other parameters are used to generate emissions which represent quantities of a compound released to the atmosphere through an associated activity.
    \begin{eqnarray} 
      %\begin{split}
      \label{Model:GC:MEGAN:eqn_emission_factors}
      %% EF_{i,j} = 
      E_i = & \gamma_i \mathlarger{\sum}_j{\epsilon_{i,j} \chi_j}
      %\end{split} 
    \end{eqnarray}
    For example: isoprene emissions are tied to sunshine, temperature, plant emission strength ($\epsilon$), emitting species coverage, etc., for each grid box.
    
  
  \subsection{Nitrogen oxides}
  \label{Model:GC:NOx}
    % How NOX affects us and how GEOS-Chem incorporates it
    NO$_X$ concentrations affect atmospheric oxidative capacity, which changes many factors important in estimating isoprene emissions including isoprene to HCHO yield, isoprene lifetime, and isoprene oxidation pathways.
    In GEOS-Chem, NO$_X$ concentrations are regulated by O$_3$, VOC, HO$_X$, Bromine and aerosols reactions.
    NO$_X$ emissions (from power generation and combustion transport) drive enhancements, while conversion to nitric acid (HNO$_3$) followed by deposition is the primary removal mechanism \parencite{Delmas1997, Ayers2006}.
    Anthropogenic emissions (TODO total Tg N a$^{-1}$) are from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), for more details visit \url{http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/EDGAR_v4.2_anthropogenic_emissions}.
    % previous versions had $\sim 21$~Tg N a$^{-1}$ from fossil fuel combustion
    Other NO$_X$ emissions arise from sources including soil emissions ($\sim 10$~Tg N a$^{-1}$), and lightning.
    Soil emissions are layed out in \textcite{Hudson2012}, parameterised using biome specific emission factors, and an explicit fertiliser dataset.
    Lightning based NO$_X$ production is created based on inventories of lightning flash rates scaled within GEOS-Chem.
    
    % How GEOS-Chem compares to satellite NO
    If GEOS-Chem is misrepresenting NO$_X$, yields and the effects of transport may be incorrectly accounted for.
    In order to determine the accuracy of GEOS-Chem simulated NO$_X$ over Australia, modelled NO$_2$ amounts are compared to satellite data (where available) for 2005.
    Figure \ref{Model:analysis:NOx:fig_NO_maps_2005} shows tropospheric NO$_2$ columns from GEOS-Chem, OMNO2d, and their differences over four seasons in 2005.
    % Geos chem vs tropno2 from omno2d
    Simulated GEOS-Chem tropospheric NO$_2$ columns averaged from 13:00-14:00 local time (LT) are compared against OMNO2d data which are averaged into seasonal \lowhr bins. %(Sec. \ref{Model:datasets:OMNO2d}). 
    Both data sets show Sydney and Melbourne as NO$_2$ hotspots; however,Sydney itself is underestimated by GEOS-Chem throughout the year, likely due to low or poorly aligned emission maps (shown in Figure \ref{Model:analysis:NOx:fig_NO_emiss_maps_2005}).
    Over much of the country GEOS-Chem overestimates NO$_2$ by 10-60\%, except in the northern areas where up to 50\% underestimation occurs in Summer.
    An underestimation in southern NSW can also be seen in the later half of the year.
    Notably GEOS-Chem anthropogenic NO does not have any seasonality (Figure \ref{Model:analysis:NOx:fig_NO_emiss_maps_2005}), while soil shows clear differences in emission hotspots between summer and winter.

    Figure \ref{Model:analysis:NOx:fig_NO_regressions_2005} shows scatter plots with one data point for each land square over Australia, for each season, coloured by total NO emissions.
    The correlation between model and satellite NO$_2$ columns is reasonable throughout the year over Australia, with a general positive bias throughout the year in modelled amounts.
    A comparison between the bias (GEOS-Chem - OMNO2d) with anthropogenic or soil emissions (columns 2 and 3 respectively) shows no real correlation, suggesting the bias is not driven by either anthropogenic or soil NO emissions in any season.
    Without a clear link between emissions and biases, alterations would be too subjective, and a change to NO$_X$ chemistry is beyond the scope of this thesis.
    Additionally, high satellite NO$_2$ columns are filtered in later calculations which assume biogenic air masses as they suggest anthropogenic influence.
    The conclusion drawn is that modelled anthropogenic and soil NO emissions do not show sufficient evidence of biasing GEOS-Chem NO$_2$ columns away from satellite measurements over Australia.
    For this reason modelled NO emissions are not modified in model runs in this thesis.

  \subsection{GEOS-Chem simulations}
    \label{Model:GC:simulations}
    
    GEOS-Chem is run five times independently in this thesis, with different outputs from each simulation used to determine specific information. 
    The different output types are first described in Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:outputs}.
    Following this is the list of model runs, including a summary of the run, outputs created, and a summary of how they are used (Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:runs}).
    Finally a brief comparison between a subset of the runs is performed (Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison}).
    
    \subsubsection{GEOS-Chem outputs}
      \label{Model:GC:simulations:outputs}
      There are various outputs available when running GEOS-Chem, some of which require manipulation in order to compare against observations.
      % Default time step and resolution of GC outputs
      GEOS-Chem in this thesis is run with a 15 minute time step for transport and 30 minutes for chemistry, at \lowhr horizontal resolution over 47 vertical levels.
      Output is the average of these time steps.
      Optionally one can save high temporally resolved data for a single (or list of) column(s).
      This has been used here to compare modelled ozone with ozonesonde profiles at three sonde release sites discussed in Chapter \ref{Ozone}.
      %For example: in this thesis, estimation of model isoprene to HCHO yields uses daily averaged HCHO columns compared against co-located isoprene emissions.
      

      \begin{description}
        \item[Midday output]%
          is output from averaging over a window of local time for each gridbox. 
          Output averaged between 13:00-14:00 local time is saved to match with Aura satellite measurements, as Aura overpasses at $\sim$1330 local time each day.
          Midday output is saved both for comparison with, and recalculation of, satellite measurements.
          %This has been performed by others \parencite[e.g.,][]{Jin2017}.
          \item[HEMCO diagnostics]:%
          the Harvard-NASA Emissions Component (HEMCO) deals with emissions inventories used in GEOS-Chem.
          % Local time offsets
          When working with globally gridded data, handling local time offsets becomes more important.
          The hourly averaged emissions of isoprene saved using GMT which needs to be offset based on longitude in order to retrieve local time.
          This is done by setting up a latitude by longitude array which matches the horizontal resolution of the data, filling each gridbox with its local time offset.
          This offset is determined as one hour per 15\degr (as 360\degr is 24 hours), and then used to retrieve global data at any specific local time.
          The retrieval of a daily local time global array is done by index matching the GMT+local time (modulo 24) with the desired hour on this grid over the 24 GMT hours.
          % Emissions are averaged over the hour for hemco diag output in biogenic run at least
        \item[Tracer averages]%
          are daily or monthly averaged gridbox concentrations. 
        \item[Time series]%
          are vertical columns with diagnostics saved at a temporal resolution of up to 15 minutes.
        
        
      \end{description}
    
    \subsubsection{GEOS-Chem runs}
      \label{Model:GC:simulations:runs}
      
      The following list summarises each model run as well as enumerating the outputs (described above), and how the run is used in the thesis.
      \begin{description}
        \item[UCX]%
          The model was run using the Universal tropospheric-stratospheric Chemistry eXtension (UCX) mechanism with 72 vertical levels from the surface to the top of the atmosphere (TOA$\sim$0.1~hPa).
          UCX runs a chemistry mechanism with combined tropospheric and stratospheric reactions, with an increased number of stratospheric calculations performed online \parencite{Eastham2014}.
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Outputs: Midday output, daily tracer averages, and time series over three stations.
            \item The Midday output is used to check how shape factors for AMF recalculation are affected by vertical resolution and stratospheric chemistry. 
            TODO: Make a plot of AMF with and without 72 vertical levels
            \item This run shows what influence the stratospheric chemistry additions have over tropospheric isoprene or HCHO concentrations.
            \item The daily tracer averages are used to determine ozone intrusion quantification (Section \ref{Ozone:fluxcalc}), and ozone concentration seasonality (Section \ref{Ozone:ModelComparison}).
            \item Time series outputs are compared against ozonesonde releases (Section \ref{Ozone:ModelComparison}) both over time and vertically.
          \end{enumerate}
        
        \item [Tropchem (standard)]%
          default settings for GEOS-Chem 10.01, using 47 vertical levels at \lowhr horizontal resolution.
          Additional midday output is created to allow AMF recalculation code to run on OMI satellite measurements (Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:ppcode}).
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Outputs: Midday output, daily tracer averages, and HEMCO diagnostics
            \item These are used in recalculation of the satellite AMF (Section \ref{Model:AMF}), and the modelled background HCHO over the remote Pacific which is used in the reference sector correction for OMI column retrievals (Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC}).
              Additional diagnostic outputs are used hard coded to allow AMF recalculation.
            \item Midday output is combined from two different runs in order to determine smearing (Section \ref{BioIsop:method:smearing})
            \item Total yearly ozone concentrations are compared before and after scaling isoprene emissions using the top-down estimate.
          \end{enumerate}
        
        \item [Tropchem (isoprene emissions halved)]%
          identical to standard tropchem except isoprene emissions are halved.
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Outputs: Midday output, and monthly tracer averages 
            \item Check modelled ozone sensitivity to isoprene emissions TODO: plot ozone between the two runs and reference here
            \item Combined with standard run to determine model sensitivity transport (Section \ref{BioIsop:method:smearing})
          \end{enumerate}
        
        \item [Tropchem (biogenic emissions only)]%
          identical to standard tropchem except all non-biogenic emissions inventories are disabled.
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Outputs: Midday output, and hourly biogenic emissions from MEGAN
            \item Midday and HEMCO outputs are used to determine isoprene to HCHO yield, after removing days with high smearing (Section \ref{BioIsop:method:slope})
            \item HEMCO diagnostics are compared against top-down estimations of isoprene emissions (Section \ref{BioIsop:results:emissions})
          \end{enumerate}
        
        \item [Tropchem (altered MEGAN scaling factor)]%
          Identical to standard tropchem except isoprene emissions are scaled to match multi-year monthly averaged top-down estimates.
          \begin{enumerate}
            \item Midday output, time series, daily averaged tracers
            \item Compare to campaign datasets after altering isoprene emissions (see Chapter \ref{BioIsop})
            \item Compare against satellite column HCHO as a sanity check on improving isoprene emissions
          \end{enumerate}
      \end{description}
    
    \subsubsection{UCX vs tropchem}
      \label{Model:GC:simulations:comparison}
      
      % brief description of both runs resolution
      Here we compare the model output with and without enabling the Universal tropospheric-stratospheric Chemistry eXtension (UCX).
      %From version 11 of GEOS-Chem, the UCX mechanism is enabled by default.
      Both runs use \lowhr latitude by longitude; however,the UCX mechanism is run with 72 vertical levels from the surface to the top of the atmosphere (TOA$\sim$0.1~hPa), while the standard (tropchem) run uses 47 levels.
      The reduced vertical levels are created by lumping together sets of the higher resolved levels from around 70~hPa to the top of the atmosphere.
      For both runs the input parameters such as MEGAN emissions and GEOS-5 meteorological fields are identical.
      
      % Figure showing differences between runs HCHO described and analysed
      Figure \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison:fig_UCXvsTrop_HCHO_surf_fullday} shows an example of surface HCHO amounts, averaged over Jan and Feb, 2007, with and without (A, B respectively) the UCX mechanism enabled.
      Surface HCHO (first model level; up to $\sim$100~m) does not differ much between runs.
      The differences do not exceed 3\% over Australia, and absolute differences are minor (note the scale in A-B).
      The major notable difference occurs over northern Africa, where HCHO is around 20\% lower in the UCX run.
      Additionally a slight ($<8\%$) decrease in HCHO over the oceans can be seen.
      The comparison is repeated using total columns (instead of surface values) in Figure \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison:fig_UCXvsTrop_HCHO_totcol_fullday}, showing that differences affecting HCHO between the model run are spread over the entire vertical column.

      % Differences between run isoprene amounts described and analysed here
      Figure \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison:fig_UCXvsTrop_isop_surf_fullday} shows the differences in surface isoprene concentrations over Australia, averaged over 1, Jan to 28, Feb, 2007.
      Here we start to see a higher relative difference in concentrations, although this is generally over the areas with less absolute concentrations. 
      Very little isoprene is seen away from the continents (4-5 orders of magnitude less), due to its short lifetime and  lack of oceanic sources.
      Generally isoprene is 0-30\% higher over mid to western Australia when the UCX mechanism is turned on; however,this increase is lower in the regions with high isoprene emissions (north-east to south-east coastline).
      This enhancement can be seen throughout the entire tropospheric column as shown by Figure \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison:fig_UCXvsTrop_isop_surf_fullday}.
      There is a greater effect in Africa and South America in the tropics, with high relative differences in many regions with low absolute amounts.

      \end{figure}
      
      
      The difference in isoprene between UCX and tropchem is likely caused by differences in the modelled radiation reaching the troposphere due to differences in simulated ozone in the stratosphere.
      Figure \ref{Model:GC:simulations:comparison:fig_UCXvsTrop_O3} shows the total column ozone between UCX and non-UCX run.
      This shows that UCX ozone is lower everywhere except for a thin band just north and south of the equator.
      With higher stratospheric ozone levels, less radiation would reach the troposphere.
      This would slow photolysis limited reactions, such as the splitting of Ozone which leads to OH production in the troposphere, in turn slowing the isoprene loss to OH reactions.

      These differences are on the order of 0-10\% and as shown later (see Section \ref{BioIsop:uncertainty}) are minimal compared to other uncertainties in both AMF calculation and emissions estimation.
      Running UCX requires roughly twice the computation (and real) hours, and for the majority of this thesis the normal tropchem runs are used.

\section{Calculating new AMF}
  \label{Model:AMF}
  
  % What is AMF again?
  One of the uses of GEOS-Chem in this thesis is to update the a priori HCHO column used in satellite measurements.
  The a priori is used when deriving the air mass factor ($AMF$), which is needed to transform satellite slant columns ($SC$) into vertical columns ($\Omega$ in molecules cm$^{-2}$):
  The AMF is the ratio of $SC$ to the vertical column
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFFrac}
    AMF=\frac{SC}{\Omega} = \frac{\tau_s}{\tau_v}
  \end{equation}
  with $\tau$ being the optical depth or thickness of the absorber through the slant (\textit{s}) or vertical (\textit{v}) path of light.
  
  
  The OMI instrument records spectra of light which enters the viewing lens on the Aura satellite.
  The spectra provide backscattered intensity ($I_B$) at various wavelengths (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho}), with the light source ($I_{B_0}$) being the sun. 
  Using the log of Beers law (Equation \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_beerslaw}) we get 
  $$ \tau_s = \ln{I_{B_0}} - \ln{I_B} $$
  which can be subbed into Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFFrac} to give an expression for the AMF which includes scattering:
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_amfscattering}
    AMF = \frac{\ln{I_{B_0}}-\ln{I_B}}{\tau_v}
  \end{equation}
  %{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_backscatterextinction}
  %$\tau_s$ is the optical thickness of the absorber along the measured path between source and instrument.
  
  We use $\nabla I = I_B - I_{B_0}$ to represent the change in intensity due to the absorber. 
  For optically thin absorption, $\nabla I / I_B << 1$, and we can use:
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFthin}
    AMF = \frac{\ln{ \left( 1 - \frac{\nabla I}{I_B} \right)} }{\tau_v} \approx \frac{ - \frac{\nabla I}{I_B} }{\tau_v}
  \end{equation}
  This is due to the logarithmic property $\ln \left(1-x \right) \approx -x$ for $x<<1$.
  $\nabla I$ can also be expressed as the integral of the absorption slices over optical depth increments: 
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \nabla I &= \int_0^{\tau_v}{\frac{\partial I_B}{\partial \tau} \mathrm{d}\tau}
    \frac{\nabla I}{I_B} & = \int_0^{\tau_v}{\frac{\partial \ln{I_B}}{\partial \tau} \mathrm{d}\tau}
  \end{eqnarray*}
  which can be placed into Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFthin} leading to
  \begin{equation*}
    AMF \approx \frac{-1}{\tau_v} \int_0^{\tau_v}{\frac{\partial \ln{I_B}}{\partial \tau} \mathrm{d}\tau}
  \end{equation*}
  We can then convert $\text{d}\tau$ to our path using Equation \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS:eqn_tau} leading to
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFcross}
    AMF = \frac{-1}{\tau_v} \int_0^\infty {\frac{\partial \ln{I_B}}{\partial \tau} \alpha(z)\eta(z)\mathrm{d}z}
  \end{equation}
  where $\alpha(z)$ and $\eta(z)$ represent absorption cross section in m$^2$ molecule$^{-1}$, and number density in molecules m$^{-3}$ respectively. 
  This uses the attenuation cross section relationship to optical depth (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho:DOAS}).
  
  To represent an average cross section weighted by the absorbing species' vertical distribution, the effective cross section ($\alpha_e$) is used.
  This is to account for temperature and pressure dependence of $\alpha(z)$, and is defined as:
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha_e &= \frac{1}{\Omega_v} \int_0^\infty \alpha(z) \eta(z) \mathrm{d}z \\
     &= \frac{\tau_v}{\Omega_v}
  \end{align*}
  Then replacing the $\tau_v$ in Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFcross} we obtain:
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFpreomega}
    AMF=-\int_0^\infty{ \frac{\partial \ln{I_B}}{\partial \tau} \frac{\alpha(z)}{\alpha_e} \frac{\eta(z)}{\Omega_v} \mathrm{d}z }
  \end{equation}
  Often the integrand of this AMF formula (Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFpreomega}) is broken apart into two defining terms: the scattering weights $\omega(z)$ and the shape factor $S(z)$, described here:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\omega$] The scattering weights describing sensitivity of the backscattered spectrum to the abundance of an absorber at altitude z:
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_omega}
      \omega(z) = -\frac{1}{AMF_G} \frac{\alpha(z)}{\alpha_e} \frac{\partial \ln{I_B}}{\partial \tau}
    \end{equation}
    It is worth noting that in the OMI satellite product, the provided $\omega(z)$ term does not include the $\frac{1}{AMF_G}$ term and the calculations which follow therefor do not include this term when utilising the provided $\omega$.
    This is not noted in any of the papers which recalculate the AMF from the OMI product, due to them recalculating the $\omega$ term themselves with a radiative transfer model such as LIDORT.
    \item[$S$] the shape factor describes the profile of an absorber ($\eta(z)$) normalised by its total vertical column amount ($\Omega_v$):
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_shapefactor}
      S(z) = \frac{\eta(z)}{\Omega_v}
    \end{equation}
  \end{description}
  
  Plugging Equations \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_omega} and \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_shapefactor} into Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFpreomega} gives us:
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_amfgintwSdz}
    AMF = AMF_G\int_0^\infty{ \omega(z) S(z) \mathrm{d}z}
  \end{equation}
  Since we are using the $\omega$ provided by OMI, the AMF$_G$ term is removed from this calculation as it is not part Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_omega} leading to 
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_intwSdz}
    AMF = \int_0^\infty{ \omega(z) S(z) \mathrm{d}z}
  \end{equation}
  
  Additionally the AMF can be determined using the sigma ($\sigma$) coordinate system, which denotes altitude as going from 1 (ground level) to 0 (TOA) (see Section \ref{Model:datasets}).
  A conversion to the $\sigma$ vertical coordinate is performed using $p = \sigma (p_S - p_T) + p_T$, where $p_T$ is pressure at the top of the atmosphere and $p_S$ is surface pressure. 
  $S_\sigma$ is a dimensionless normalised shape factor on the $\sigma$ coordinate system.
  In the sigma coordinate system we calculated the shape factor as defined in \textcite{Palmer2001}:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{Model:AMF:eqn_ShapeFactorSigma}
    S_\sigma(\sigma) = \frac{\Omega_a}{\Omega_v}C_{HCHO}(\sigma)
  \end{equation}
  where $\Omega_a$ is the vertical column of air from the surface to the top of the atmosphere and C$_{HCHO}(\sigma)$ is the mixing ratio of HCHO.
  We can integrate over the sigma coordinates using the hydrostatic relation $p = - \rho_a g z$, with $\rho_a$ being air density, and $g$ the gravitational acceleration:
  \begin{align*}
    \rho_a g z & = \sigma \left( p_S - p_T \right) + p_T \\
    \mathrm{d}\sigma  & = - \frac{ \rho_a g }{ p_S - p_T } \mathrm{d}z
  \end{align*}
  Substitution into \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_intwSdz} gives AMF using the sigma coordinates:
  \begin{equation} \label{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFintwSdsigma}
    AMF = \int_0^1 w(\sigma) S_\sigma(\sigma) \mathrm{d}\sigma
  \end{equation}

\section{Recalculation of OMI HCHO}
  \label{Model:omiRecalc}
  
  
  % Reiteration of why we recalculate AMFs
  %from Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFFrac}:
  %\begin{equation*} %\label{Model:omiRecalc:eqn_AMFratio}
  %%  AMF = \frac{SC}{\Omega} %= \frac{\tau_s}{\tau_v}
  %\end{equation*}
  OMI HCHO vertical columns are calculated using modelled a priori HCHO profiles (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho}).
  When comparing satellite measurements against models it is important to recognise the impact of this a priori on the total column values.
  This is complicated by how OMI is differently sensitive to HCHO (and other trace gases) vertically throughout the atmosphere.
  When comparing OMI vertical columns ($\Oomi$) to GEOS-Chem ($\Ogc$), the satellite AMF needs to be recalculated using GEOS-Chem modelled vertical gas profiles as the a prioris.
  Without performing this step a bias between modelled and measured total column values may be due to the a priori rather than chemistry or measurements \parencite{Palmer2001, Lamsal2014}.
  
  
  % Very brief outline
  Here, two new AMFs are calculated, both using GEOS-Chem HCHO profiles as the new a priori. 
  The first (AMF$_{GC}$) uses the original satellite scattering weights while recalculating the shape factor, whereas the second (AMF$_{PP}$) also recalculates scattering weights.
  AMF$_{PP}$ is created using code initially written by Professor P. Palmer. % (see section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:AMF} for more details).
  A reference sector correction is determined using the method described in \textcite{Abad2016}. %(see Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC}).
  This correction has also been applied to the original vertical column in the OMHCHO product, so the column is available with and without this correction.
  The reference sector correction is unique for each of the 60 measurement tracks used by OMI.
  The correction is calculated for each of the two new vertical columns, and applied to each pixel to create the corrected vertical columns. 
  The end product is three sets of corrected vertical columns: the original, one using GEOS-Chem to recalculate the shape factors, and one from Palmer's code using GEOS-Chem to both recalculate shape factors and scattering weights.
  
  \subsection{Outline}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:outline}
    
    % Summary of actual actions taken:
    An outline in computational order of what takes place when recalculating the $\Omega$ from OMI follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:shape_factors} describes how GEOS-Chem satellite overpass output %(see Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:outputs})
        is used to create new shape factors (S$_z$ and S$_\sigma$).
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Vertical pressure edges and geometric midpoints are determined, along with altitudes (\textit{z}), and box heights (H).
        \item Number density and mixing ratio of HCHO ($n_{HCHO}$, $C_{HCHO}$ respectively) are taken or created from model outputs HCHO (ppb), air density (molec cm$^{-3}$), and box heights (m).
        \item Total column HCHO from GEOS-Chem ($\Ogc$) is calculated 
        \begin{equation*}
          \Ogc = \Sigma_z \left(n_{HCHO}(z) \times H(z) \right)
        \end{equation*}
        along with total column air ($\Omega_{A}$, calculated similarly).
        \item The shape factor S$_z(z)$ is calculated for each altitude 
        \begin{equation*}
          S_z(z) = n_{HCHO} / \Omega_{HCHO}
        \end{equation*}
        \item Sigma coordinates are created from pressures (see Section \ref{Model:datasets}, Equation \ref{Model:datasets:eqn_sigma_pressure}).
        \item S$_\sigma(z)$ is calculated on each altitude: 
        \begin{equation*}
          S_\sigma(z) = C_{HCHO}(z) \times \frac{\Omega_A}{\Omega_{HCHO}}
        \end{equation*}
      \end{enumerate}
      \item For each pixel, new AMF (AMF$_{GC}$ and AMF$_{PP}$) is created using the GEOS-Chem shape factors and satellite scattering weights in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:AMF}:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Satellite pixels (SC, scattering weights ($\omega(z)$), pressure levels, latitude and longitude) are read from the OMHCHO dataset.
        \item scattering weights ($\omega$) are interpolated onto the same vertical dimensions (\textit{z} and $\sigma$) as the shape factors.
        \item Integration (approximated using rectangular method) is performed along the vertical dimension to calculate the new AMF on both coordinate systems:
        \begin{align}
          AMF_z &= \Sigma_z \left(\omega(z) \times S_z(z) \times H(z)\right) \\
          AMF_{\sigma} &= \Sigma_{\sigma} \left(\omega(\sigma) \times S_{\sigma}(\sigma) \times d\sigma \right)
        \end{align}
        These two AMFs represent the same thing using different coordinates, and either one can be used as the AMF$_{GC}$.
        \item Code from Dr. Surl and Professor Palmer is used to recalculate both the shape factor and scattering weights to produce AMF$_{PP}$.
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:vertical_columns} describes how the original AMF, AMF$_{PP}$, and AMF$_{GC}$ are used to determine the new vertical columns: $\Omega = SC/AMF$.
      \item A reference sector correction (RSC) is defined each day using these AMFs along with modelled HCHO over the remote Pacific in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC}:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item GEOS-Chem midday output ($\Omega_{GEOS-Chem}$ from 140{\degr}W to 160{\degr}W) are averaged monthly and longitudinally to provide modelled vertical columns over the reference sector.
        \item These vertical columns ($\Omega_{GEOS-Chem}$) are turned into modelled slant columns by multiplication with the AMF over the reference sector:
        \begin{equation*}
          SC_{GEOS-Chem} = \Omega_{GEOS-Chem} \times AMF
        \end{equation*}
        \item For each satellite pixel in the reference sector, a correction ($corr$) is calculated as the measured $SC$ minus the modelled slant column at the nearest latitude:
        \begin{equation*}
          corr[lat,track] = SC[lat,track] - VC_{GEOS-Chem}[lat] \times AMF
        \end{equation*}
        \item These corrections are binned by satellite detector (track: 1-60), and latitude (0.36\degr; 500 latitudes from 90{\degr}S to 90{\degr}N).
        \item The median entry of each bin is determined and this forms the RSC[lat,track] (e.g., Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC:fig_track_correction_interpolations}).
      \end{enumerate}
      \item $VCC$ are determined using $VCC = (SC - RSC[lat,track] )/AMF$ for each measured SC and using each AMF, with the RSC linearly interpolated to the latitude of the satellite pixel (see Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:vcc}).
      \item The VCC (along with most of the pixel and GEOS-Chem data) are binned onto a \highhr grid along with other information (see Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:binning}).
    \end{enumerate}
 
    
      
  
  \subsection{Creating new shape factors}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:shape_factors}
    % Reminder of AMF -> leading to what is the shapefactor
    To visualise and analyse OMI HCHO columns, slant columns are transformed into vertical columns using the AMF.
    The shape factor ($S$) is one of the key components in creation of the AMF (see Section \ref{Model:AMF}, Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_intwSdz}).
    The shape factor is calculated using GEOS-Chem midday output (see Section \ref{Model:GC:simulations:outputs}) which provide simulated HCHO concentration profiles ($\eta(z)$) and total columns ($\Omega$) at \lowhr horizontal resolution.
    Using Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_shapefactor} to determine the shape factor is straightforwards $S(z) = \frac{\eta(z)}{\Omega}$.
    The associated OMI per-pixel scattering weights are not changed in this calculation (unlike in Section \ref{Model:omiRecalc:ppcode}).
    
    Model output is provided as mixing ratios ($C$ in ppbv), and is converted before being used in the shape factor calculation.
    The following equation converts model profile output from ppbv into number density ($\eta$) in molecules cm$^{-3}$:
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:omiRecalc:eqn_ppb_to_n}
      \eta_{HCHO} = C_{HCHO} \times \eta_a \times 10^{-9}
    \end{equation}
    where $\eta_{HCHO}$ is the number density of HCHO, $\eta_a$ is the number density of air (from model output), and $C_{HCHO}$ is the mixing ratio of HCHO.
    The modelled total vertical column $\Omega_{HCHO}$ is determined by:
    \begin{equation*}
      \Omega_{HCHO} = \Sigma_z \left( \eta_{HCHO} \times H(z) \right)
    \end{equation*}
    where $H(z)$ is the box height for altitude $z$.
    In effect this equation sums over the molecules per cm$^2$ in each altitude level.
    
    As a sanity check $S_\sigma$ is calculated (through Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_ShapeFactorSigma}) to confirm that these shape factors are equivalent.
    Comparing the resulting AMFs created by Equations \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFintwSdsigma} and \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_intwSdz} for each pixel provides confidence in the unit conversions (and other factors) applied.
    These AMF values are nearly identical in practice (correlation coefficient $> 0.99$).
    

  % How we get the a priori 
  \subsection{Creating new AMF using GEOS-Chem}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:AMF}
    
    \subsubsection{Updating shape factors}
    
      From Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMF_intwSdz} we have:
      $$ AMF = \int_0^\infty \omega(z) S(z) \mathrm{d}z $$
      Using the $\omega(z)$ from satellite data, along with our calculated $S_z$ interpolated linearly onto the same vertical grid as $\omega(z)$, the AMF can be determined through integration.
      The integration is performed using a simple rectangular method, which multiplies the integrand midpoints by the change in height, and then takes the sum for each vertical box.
      This assumes that the provided scattering weights and shape factors are linear between the 47 resolved values.
    
    \subsubsection{Recalculating the AMF using PP code}
      \label{Model:omiRecalc:ppcode}
      % pp code for AMF recalculation referred to as pp code
      
      %You'll only be showing the Australia ones, right? So I don't think you need this. Instead, I think you need to start this section by saying that a limitation of the method described in the previous subsection is that the scattering weights can also depend on the model atmosphere, which is not taken into account when only the shape factor is recalculated.
      
      The major limitation of vertical columns which implement $AMF_{GC}$ is that the scattering weights also depend on the model atmosphere, which is not updated when only the shape factor is recalculated.
      This is addressed using Fortran code written by Paul Palmer and Randal Martin, subsequently updated by Luke Surl.
      This Fortran code (PP code) is computationally expensive, and is run on a subset of the globe (50-10\degr~S, 160\degr~W-160\degr~E) covering Australia and the Pacific ocean.
      This allows both vertical column recalculation and reference sector correction..
      The instrument sensitivity (or scattering weights; $\omega$) and shape factors for each pixel are calculated within the PP code.
      
      The code uses a combination of GEOS-Chem a priori profile information and satellite measurement data to calculate the $AMF_{PP}$ by using LIDORT radiative transfer calculations to determine scattering.
      
      
      Code for recalculating AMF using satellite swaths and modelled aerosol optical depths and gas profiles can be found at \url{http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/martin/?page_id=129}. 
      The coded method is detailed in \textcite{Palmer2001}, with modifications for clouds and use of the LIDORT radiative transfer model \parencite{Spurr2002} as described by \textcite{Martin2003}.
      Modifications performed by Luke Surl at University of Edinburgh enabled the PP code to utilise OMI satellite data.
      Additionally, required tropopause heights averaged within satellite overpass times are created by modifying the GEOS-Chem diagnostic output.
      The calculation of $\omega$(z) is simplified by using large ``look up tables'' of values based on many parameters such as cloud top heights and optical depths.
      These AMF look up tables can be found in the source code at \url{https://github.com/LukeSurl/amf581g}.
      The PP code uses HCHO concentration profiles averaged between 1300 and 1400 LT, including optical depths at 550~nm, and dust concentrations from GEOS-Chem, along with a subset of the OMI pixel information.
      The required information is taken from OMHCHO daily swath files, and sorted into csv files (one per day) which are then read by the PP code in conjunction with the GEOS-Chem outputs for each day.
      The PP code then produces a list of recalculated AMF which are read by python code and associated with the corresponding satellite pixel (outlined in \ref{Model:omiRecalc:fig_flow_omhchorp}).
    
    
      
    \subsubsection{Saving the AMF with satellite pixels}
      
      % Downloading the data
      OMI satellite pixels are read and filtered for quality (see Section \ref{Model:omhcho:pixel_filtering}) and have their AMFs calculated as shown above. 
      The process is outlined in figure  \ref{Model:omiRecalc:fig_flow_omhchorp} for a single day.
      This filtering removes highly uncertain pixels, including row anomaly affected pixels.
      % reading pixels into a long list
      Additional information is added to each pixel, including the new AMFs.
      Each pixel and its relevant data are saved in a long list for subsequent processing.
      %The shape factors and scattering weights for each pixel lie along a z-axis which is vertically resolved to 47 layers.
    

  \subsection{Vertical columns from AMF}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:vertical_columns}
    All that remains for recalculating the total vertical column using our new a priori shape factor is to apply the new AMF to the slant columns and grid them onto our chosen resolution.
    Each satellite pixel at this stage has an associated SC along with three $AMF$s: the original ($AMF_{OMI}$), one with recalculated shape factors (AMF$_{GC}$), and one completely recalculated using PP code (AMF$_{PP}$).
    These are used to create vertical columns ($\Omega$) through Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFFrac}: $\Omega = SC/AMF$.
    
    Figure TODO shows a comparison between the three satellite $\Omega$ over Australia for 2005. 
    The first row shows the yearly average column amounts, as well as coloured rectangles describing regions which are averaged over time in row 3.
    Row two from left to right shows the relative differences between $\Omega$ calculated using $AMF_{PP}$ and $AMF_{GC}$, $AMF_{OMI}$ and $AMF_{GC}$, and $AMF_{OMI}$ and $AMF_{PP}$.

  \subsection{Reference sector correction}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:RSC}
    
    % Why we apply a reference sector correction
    On a medium to long time scale, OMI degradation needs to be accounted for.
    To remove effects from the deterioration of the satellite instrument, measurements over the remote pacific (our reference sector) are combined with GEOS-Chem simulations to create a reference sector correction (RSC).
    In this thesis we use OMI HCHO columns to estimate isoprene emissions, and correcting background HCHO does not affect this calculation.
    % hcho over the remote Pacific ocean is expected to be relatively invariable.
    The correction should reduce bias caused by satellite degradation, without impacting isoprene emissions estimation.
    The RSC corrects for several problems; however, it introduces some a priori model influence.
    One corrected problem is the potential influence of varying dead/hot pixel masks across the OMI 2-D detector array \parencite{DeSmedt2015}.
    This method also corrects for the errors introduced through correlations between BrO and HCHO absorption cross sections, which are especially significant at high latitudes \parencite{Abad2015}.
    
    % where we apply the RSC
    HCHO products from OMI and SCIAMACHY both use a median daily remote Pacific ocean radiance reference spectrum, over 15$^{\circ}$S-15$^{\circ}$N, 140$^{\circ}$-160$^{\circ}$W where it is assumed that the only significant source of HCHO is methane oxidation \parencite{DeSmedt2008,Barkley2013,Kurosu2014}.
    Here a new reference sector correction is created using modelled and measured HCHO columns over the remote Pacific to produce corrected vertical columns ($VCC$).
    This follows \textcite{Abad2016}, and defines the remote Pacific as the band between 140{\degr}W to 160{\degr}W.
    Each satellite slant column measurement is corrected by how much the satellite reference sector measurements at that latitude diverge from modelled amounts over the reference sector.
    
    
    % How my RSC is defined
    Modelled slant columns over the reference sector ($SC_{GEOS-Chem}$) are calculated by multiplying modelled vertical columns with the AMF calculated in prior sections using Equation \ref{Model:AMF:eqn_AMFFrac}: 
    \begin{equation*}
      SC_{GEOS-Chem} = \Omega_{GEOS-Chem} \times AMF
    \end{equation*}
    % Then RSC Longitudinally averaged, binned into 500 lats
    The longitudinal average is taken within the remote Pacific, as corrections are (assumed to be) longitudinally invariant.
    These modelled slant columns are averaged over the month and interpolated latitudinally to 500 equidistant bins.
    Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC:fig_RSCeg} shows the simulated reference sector vertical columns as an example, calculated for January 1st 2005.
    In this figure the latitudinal resolution is increased from 2\degr to 0.36\degr, through linear interpolation, in order to form 500 vertical bins which are used in correcting the satellite data.
    This resolution is chosen to match that of \textcite{Abad2016}.

    }
    {\label{Model:omiRecalc:RSC:fig_RSCeg}}
    
    
    % Swath RSC corrections are done 'per track'
    For OMI swaths, each row of measured data contains 60 ``Across track'' (track) measurements.
    The track index $i$ relates the measurement to one of the 60 columns of data.
    Corrections (molecules cm$^{-2}$) for each measurement are calculated by taking the difference between the measured slant column and the a priori slant column as follows:
    \begin{equation} \label{Model:omiRecalc:eqn_RSC}
      Correction(i,j) = SC(i,j) - \Omega_{GEOS-Chem}(lat(j)) \times {AMF}(i,j)
    \end{equation}
    where $j$ represents a latitude index.
    The RSC is this list of $Correction$ values binned by latitude using medians, and used per pixel based on the linear interpolation to that pixels latitude.
    % Correction applied over each of the 60 tracks
    The RSC is independently calculated for each of the 60 tracks, at each latitude in the 500 0.36\degr bins.
    This provides a different RSC for each of the three AMFs.
    % Interpolated daily RSC to cover missing latitudes
    Due to incomplete latitudinal coverage, the correction for each track is interpolated linearly between measurements, with corrections outside of the highest measured latitudes being equal to the corrections at the highest measured latitudes.
    
    Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC:fig_track_correction_interpolations} shows an example of the 60 track corrections for January 1st 2005
    The points are satellite measurements longitudinally averaged over the remote Pacific, coloured by track number.
    % Visualisation of RSC refering to plot and 8-day averaged corrections
    Another way to look at this correction is given in the OMI corrections panel of Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:RSC:fig_RSCeg}, which has tracks along the x axis and latitude on the y axis.
    This figure shows how corrections are distributed (over this 8-day sample) with more negative values towards the outside tracks, especially in the tropics.

  \subsection{Corrected vertical columns}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:vcc}
    
    % How Vertical columns use reference sector corrections
    %Vertical columns in OMI use an oceanic background instead of a solar irradiance spectrum when calculating trace gas interference with DOAS calculations.
    Corrected vertical columns, or VCC, are created using the difference between slant columns ($SC$) and reference sector corrections (RSC, detailed in prior section) divided by the AMF. 
    %TODO Check this and update this equation to make sense and use the right abbreviations:
    \begin{equation}
      \label{Model:omiRecalc:vcc:eqn_vcc}
      VCC = \frac{ \left( SC - RSC \right) }{ AMF }
    \end{equation}
    This is equivalent to taking the difference between the slant column and its measured reference sector equivalent ($SC_0$), and then adding the modelled reference sector column ($\Omega_{GC,0}$):
    \begin{equation}
      \label{Model:omiRecalc:vcc:eqn_vcc_equiv}
      VCC = \frac{ \left( SC - SC_0 \right) }{ AMF } + \Omega_{GC,0}
    \end{equation}
    This method is used in several works, including \textcite[e.g.,][]{DeSmedt2008, DeSmedt2012, DeSmedt2015, Barkley2013, Bauwens2016}.
    Recently this correction was expanded (for OMI data) to include latitudinal and instrument track influence by \textcite{Abad2015}.
    
    % One correction per pixel, based on latitude and omi track
    One correction (from Equation \ref{Model:omiRecalc:eqn_RSC}) is associated with every good satellite measurement which is used to create a reference sector corrected measurement (Vertical Column Corrected or VCC) through the following equation:
    \begin{equation}
    VCC(i,j) = \frac{SC_{HCHO}(i,j) - Correction(i,lat(j))}{AMF(i,j)}
    \end{equation}
    For each good satellite measurement the corrected vertical column is calculated two times, once using each new AMF.
    
    

  \subsection{Binning the results daily}
    \label{Model:omiRecalc:binning}
    Finally the pixels are binned into a gridded dataset named OMHCHORP, as shown in Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:fig_flow_omhchorp}.
    The resolution is chosen to match the native resolution of the GEOS meteorological fields (\highhr).
    A bin entry count is used to allow easy re-binning, and can be used to check for sparse data days due to filtering.
    Data averaged into this dataset:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item OMI slant column %($\Os$)
      \item OMI air mass factor %(AMF$_{OMI}$)
      \item OMI vertical column %($\Omega_{V,OMI}$
      \item OMI corrected vertical column %($\Omega_{VC,OMI}$)
      \item GEOS-Chem recalculated air mass factor %(AMF$_{GC}$)
      \item GEOS-Chem recalculated vertical column %($\Omega_{V,GC}$)
      \item GEOS-Chem recalculated corrected vertical column %
      \item GEOS-Chem air mass factor recalculated using PP code (AMF$_{PP}$)
      \item GEOS-Chem corrected vertical column based on PP code
      \item satellite pixel counts (summed into bins)
      \item OMI vertical column fitting uncertainty
      % Fires are now stored separately
      %\item Smoke AAOD from OMAERUVd mapped into bins from 1x1\degr resolution (described in Section \ref{Model:filter:fire})
      %\item fire counts (summed into bins)
    \end{enumerate}
    
    This process requires processing time and storage space, and is performed on the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI) supercomputer.
    In order to reprocess one year of swath files ($\sim 162$~GB $ = 142 + 16 + 4$~GB OMHCHO, MOD14A1, and OMNO2d respectively per year) of daily data was downloaded and then transformed into $\sim 8$~GB (per year) of daily gridded data.
    This takes around 90 minutes per day; however, each day is completely independent and can be run in parallel once model output is available.
    Initially parallelism was built into the python code; however, simply running python code independently for each date was simpler and more scalable.
    As much as possible this work uses HDF-5 or NetCDF-4 formats, although GEOS-Chem output is in bitpunch format.
    The scripts to regrid and reprocess the swath data set are available from github at \url{https://github.com/jibbals/OMI_regridding}.
  
  \subsection{Difference between original and corrected OMI HCHO columns}
  
    
    Corrected vertical columns ($VCC$) of HCHO are created at \highhr ~horizontal resolution.
    Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:diff:fig_vcc_comparison} shows how the recalculated columns compare to the original (OMI, left). 
    Recalculation increases the January column amounts while also slightly flattening the distributions (row 3).
    Recalculated columns show more high concentration ($>1.5$ \moleccm) columns and lower background concentrations over the ocean.
    Together this may lead to a slightly steeper continental enhancement which may be expected since elsewhere OMI HCHO is seen to be up to 40\% underestimated \parencite[e.g.]{Zhu2016,DeSmedt2015,Barkley2013}.
    %The effect of not recalculating the $\omega_z$ can also be seen in Figure \ref{Model:omiRecalc:fig_VCC_pp_fires} which shows the altered satellite vertical columns using each method.

\section{Filtering Data}
  \label{Model:filter}
  
  % Why filter data
  A major goal in this work is to infer biogenic isoprene emissions from HCHO columns.
  Isoprene is the dominant source of HCHO over continental land masses; however, other precursor NVMOCs can contribute to observed HCHO.
  The main interference in the biogenic isoprene signal in HCHO comes from fire smoke plumes and major anthropogenic source regions.
  Biomass burning can be a large local or transported (via smoke plumes) source of HCHO, glyoxal (CHOCHO), and other compounds which influence HCHO levels.
  Anthropogenic emissions from power generation, transport, and agriculture can influence these levels as well.
  So to infer biogenic isoprene emissions, pyrogenic and anthropogenic influences should be removed (where possible) from modelled and measured data.
  In GEOS-Chem we simply turn off pyrogenic and anthropogenic emissions; however, in the OMI HCHO satellite product we mask potentially affected pixels.
  
  
  In this work anthropogenic and pyrogenic influences on the OMHCHO satellite HCHO columns are removed by masking active fires, high AAOD, and high NO$_2$ levels measured by satellite.
  Active fires and suspected smoke plumes are masked, and together termed the pyrogenic filter.
  NO$_2$ measurements are used to mask potential anthropogenic influence.  
  %These masks negatively affect uncertainty,  as fewer measurements are available to be averaged.
  %This section describes the creation and effects of filters used on satellite data.
  A summary of filtering over Australian land squares at \highhr resolution is provided in Table \ref{Model:filter:tab_summary_pixels_masked}.
  Figure \ref{Model:filter:fig_pixel_loss_Jan06} shows an example month of anthropogenic and pyrogenic filtering, highlighting how many days and pixels are removed across Australia.
  The anthropogenic filter completely removes grid squares over Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney. 
  Other major cities in Australia either do not emit enough NO$_2$ or are too dispersed and do not breach the threshold to be filtered as anthropogenic.
  Pyrogenic filtering removes upwards of 10\% of the available pixel measurements per year.
  This filter tends to cover forested areas (as they are more prone to burning) as well as some hot spots that are likely due gas flaring or burning.

  \subsection{Pyrogenic filter}
    \label{Model:filter:fire}
    
    % Products making up the pyro filter
    MODIS fire counts are used in conjunction with smoke AAOD enhancements from OMI to remove data points which may be affected by fires or fire smoke plumes.
    %The method used in this thesis follows that of \textcite{Marais2012} and \textcite{Barkley2013}, with active fires filtered using fire counts and smoke filtered using smoke AAOD.
    The MODIS fire counts come from a combination of measurements from the Terra and Aqua satellites (Terra overpasses at 10:30, 22:30 LT; Aqua at 13:30, 01:30 LT).
    satellite AAOD from product OMAERUVd (described in Section \ref{Model:datasets:OMAERUVd}) is analysed over Australia to determine a suitable filter threshold.
    AAOD is used instead of an alternative product AOD as it is less sensitive to the presence of clouds \parencite{Ahn2008}.
    
    % My method for fire filtering:
    OMHCHO total column HCHO $\Omega$ is processed into a \highhr horizontal daily grid.
    Pyrogenic filters are interpolated to the same horizontal resolution as $\Omega$ to simplify application. 
    The following steps are performed to create the pyrogenic influence mask:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item MOD14A1 daily gridded Aqua/Terra combined fire counts (1x1~km$^2$) are binned into \highhr bins (matching the resolution of binned $\Omega$).
      \item A rolling mask is formed which removes $\Omega$ if one or more fires are detected in a grid square, or in the adjacent grid square, up to 2 days previously.
      This includes the current day, making 3 days of fires in total being filtered out on each day.
      \item AAOD at 500~nm is mapped from OMAERUVd (1x1\degr resolution) onto the \highhr resolution.
      \item An AAOD threshold of 0.03 is determined through visual analysis of AAOD distributions over several days, including days with and without influence from active fires, dust, and transported smoke plumes. 
      Grid squares with AAOD over this threshold are considered potentially affected by transported fire smoke.
    \end{enumerate}
    This method of masking fires can be compared to \textcite{Marais2012} and \textcite{Barkley2013}:
    \textcite{Marais2012} removed pixels colocated with non zero fire counts in any of the prior eight days, within grid squares with 1\degr$\times 1$\degr resolution, and \textcite{Barkley2013} used fires from the preceding and current day, within local or adjacent grid squares, at \highhr resolution.
    
    % How other people have filtered fires
    %Influence from biomass burning can be removed %through measurements of acetonitrile and CO \parencite[e.g.,][]{Wolfe2016, Miller2017}, or else removal of 
    %by using satellite detected fire counts and aerosol absorption optical depth \parencite{Marais2014}.
    
    %In situ fire influence
    %\textcite{Wolfe2016} disregard HCHO measurements when acetonitrile > 210~pptv and CO > 300~ppbv, while acetonitrile > 200~pptv is used to determine fire influence in \textcite{Miller2017}.
    
    
    
    % Smoke AAOD filtering:
    Determining the AAOD due to smoke can be difficult since both smoke and dust absorb UV radiation \parencite{Ahn2008, Marais2012}.
    AAOD filtering is designed to remove pixels affected by smoke; however, it may occasionally remove pixels affected by dust.
    Dust in Australia is highly episodic and false positives in the smoke filter should not affect more than a few days per month, especially over regions with high tree coverage \parencite{Shao2007}.
    % Threshold for AAOD determination
    % repeats steps taken paragraph
    %The smoke filter is created by removing OMHCHO grid squares where the AAOD is above 0.03, after the AAOD is mapped from 1\degr$\times 1$\degr to the same \highhr resolution as our OMHCHO gridded product.
    The threshold is determined through analysing AAOD over Australia in 4 scenarios: normal conditions, active local fires, transported fire smoke, and large scale dust storms.
    An example of these scenarios and the AAOD distributions is shown in Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_typicalAAOD}. 
    This figure shows AAOD maps and distributions, along with satellite imagery on the same day in column 4 (from \url{https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/}).

    % Compare smoke to fire+smoke mask
    Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_smokefilter} shows the number of grid square days filtered by the smoke mask and pyrogenic mask (smoke and active fires combined) over 2005.
    The Lake Eyre basin is the area most affected by smoke filtering, likely due to dust influence in the arid region.
    The scale of days filtered by the active fires mask is more than 4 times that of the smoke mask, and is more prominent over heavily forested areas such as the northern and eastern coast lines.
    Masking for active fires impacts analysis to a far greater extent than masking smoke.

    Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_portion_filtered_2005} shows the extent of pixels filtered out by the pyrogenic filter over 2005. 
    The highest concentrations of removed pixels lie along the northern and eastern coastlines, and correspond with forested areas (see Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_forest_coverage}), which suggests that forest fires are being masked properly.
    Central Australia is largely unmasked, which could be due to a lack of sufficient vegetation to create fires and smoke visible by satellite.
    %Even though transported smoke plumes from South America and southern Africa would influence the measurements in the area.
    The proliferation of petrol or gas wells (see Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_petrol_and_gas}) may also lead to AAOD enhancement wherever activity stirs up dust, and could be mistaken as active fires wherever gas flaring occurs.
    %JENNY NOTE: As written this section is unnecessarily wordy and a bit confusing. Just show both 2005 and 2012 in the figure and state this at the outset. If you see growth in filter detections then you can discuss the change over time in oil and gas wells
    In 2005, 388 gas wells existed in Queensland; however, more than 2000 wells (cumulative) were approved by 2013 which may cause more filtering over the analysed time period in this thesis \parencite{Carlisle2012}.
    To check this the filtering portion for 2012 is also plotted in Figure TODO: plot map of filtered squares for 2012 when it has been run by NCI.
    One clear hot spot is located over Port Kembla (south of Sydney), most likely due to the flame which burns over the blast furnace stack throughout the year (\url{https://www.bluescopeillawarra.com.au/community/skylineimages/}).
    Another hot spot can be seen in Western Australia over Kalgoorlie, where a large open cut gold mine is always open and blasting daily TODO: Reference.
    In Western Queensland over Mount Isa there is again a mining hotspot TODO: Reference.
    A large area in southern Queensland/northern NSW is also heavily filtered, potentially due to gas flaring in the Surat Basin, which has thousands of petrol and gas wells (\url{http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/resources/petroleum-resources/gas}).

      % Used to be subsubsection looking at hcho vs temp vs fire...
      Biogenic HCHO concentrations should be correlated with temperature, since isoprene emissions are strongly correlated with temperature \parencite{Palmer2006, Zhu2013_poster, Surl2018}.
      Fires emit HCHO precursors and increase HCHO concentrations independently of the relationship between temperature and HCHO, and should be revealed as outliers when comparing HCHO to temperature.
      Figures \ref{Model:analysis:HCHO:fig_hcho_vs_temp_SEA_200501} - \ref{Model:analysis:HCHO:fig_hcho_vs_temp_SWA_200501} show the relationship between modelled temperature, and satellite HCHO for January 2005 within subsets of Australia.
      A reduced major axis regression is used to determine the correlation between surface temperature (X axis) and HCHO (Y axis).
      Using the natural log of HCHO we can take the linear regression and then exponentiate each side in the equation $\ln{Y} = m{X}+b$ to get ${Y} = \exp{m{X}+b}$. 
      This gives us the exponential fit as shown, with the correlation coefficient between $\ln{HCHO}$ and temperature.
      The distributions of exponential correlation coefficients and $m$ terms is shown in the embedded plot, with one datapoint available for each grid square where the regression is performed.
      These figures show that the modelled temperature does is not well correlated with corrected recalculated OMI vertical columns (r ranges from -0.24 to 0.47), but is with modelled columns (r ranges from 0.49 to 0.84).
      Correlations between modelled temperatures and HCHO are further improved when using the spatial average within each region.
      Further, we see that the relationship is improved in individual grid squares over south Eastern Australia by removing non-biogenic emissions from the model (r increased from 0.58 to 0.75).
      This improvement is not seen in Northern Australia, nor south Western Australia.
      Overall this suggests that modelled correlations between temperature and HCHO are spatially dependent, and generally well reflected in satellite measurements over Australia.

      One problem with detecting outliers in the temperature and enhanced HCHO relationship is that days when fires occur are likely to be hot.
      Another problem with correlating heat and HCHO is that increased temperature accelerates HCHO destruction \parencite{Zheng2015}.
      We test the fire mask by examining the relationship between modelled temperature and satellite HCHO with and without applying the filters for smoke and active fires.
      Figures \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_HCHO_vs_GC_temperature} and \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_HCHO_vs_CPC} show the regressions between OMI HCHO total columns and temperature from GEOS-Chem output and CPC daily maximum temperatures respectively.

      The left column in Figure \ref{Model:filter:fire:fig_HCHO_vs_GC_temperature} shows scatter and RMA correlation within a single grid box over 2 months from Jan 1 to Feb 28, 2005, without having applied either the fire nor anthropogenic masks to OMI HCHO columns. 
      The right column shows the same correlation after applying the fire filter, affected data points are marked in teal (matching the red marked points in the left column).
      The analysis is repeated for Sydney, Canberra, and three grid squares to the north-west, west, and southwest of Sydney (w1, w2, w3 respectively).

  \subsection{Anthropogenic filter}
    \label{Model:filter:NOx}
    
    % Why filter high NO? Anthro influence
    %Need to explicitly state that you are not suggesting that anthropogenic NOx leads to HCHO, but that it is likely to be co-located with anthropogenic NMVOCs that form HCHO and therefore would bias your inversion. In other words, you are using NOx as a proxy for possible anthropogenic NMVOC influence.
    Enhanced NO$_2$ concentrations indicate anthropogenic influence over Australia.
    We use NO$_2$ as a proxy for potential anthropogenic NMVOC emissions, as these could bias the inversion performed in Chapter \ref{BioIsop}.
    A filter is designed using the tropospheric NO$_2$ columns in the OMNO2d product.
    
    % Nox analysis from OMNO2d
    NO$_2$ columns near several major cities in south eastern Australia over 2005 are used to determine a suitable threshold for anthropogenic influence.
    The mean, standard deviation, and time series over Australia of tropospheric NO$_2$ measured by satellite is shown in Figure \ref{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_timeseries}.
    Tropospheric NO$_2$ columns averaged within all of Australia and each region is shown in Figure \ref{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_timeseries}.
    Anthropogenic influences are clearly visible near major cities in Australia, and some influence can be seen along nearly every coastline.

    {\label{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_timeseries}}
    
    % Filters and Threshhold determination and reasoning
    The anthropogenic filter is created for each year from in two steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Daily grid squares with NO$_2$ greater than 10$^{15}$\moleccm  ~are flagged as anthropogenic.
      \item After taking the yearly average for each grid square, any tropospheric NO$_2$ columns greater than $1.5 \times 10^{15}$\moleccm are flagged for the whole year.
    \end{enumerate}
    These thresholds are chosen subjectively through trial and error so as to ensure the removal of definite anthropogenic influence while not removing too many data points over near uninhabited portions of Australia.
    These thresholds completely remove grid squares over major cities which are likely emitting NMVOCs year round, and also frequently remove grid squares down wind.
    The affects of applying this filter to the OMNO2d product itself can be seen in Figure \ref{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_threshaffect}.
    Areas over major cities in south eastern Australia do not lie outside the IQR of Australian NO$_2$ tropospheric columns once the filter is applied.
    Many coastal regions show some effect from the filtering, and Sydney, Melbourne, and east of Melbourne are completely removed.

    The same regions as in Figure \ref{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_timeseries} are shown again in Figure \ref{Model:filter:NOx:fig_omno2_densities}, with NO$_2$ pixel densities for each region shown, along with the threshold of $1 \times 10^{15}$\moleccm.
    This led to a reduction of TODO grid squares from the total available measurement space over Australia.
    The removal of grid squares which went above the yearly averaged limit of $1.5 \times 10^{15}$\moleccm ~further reduced the available data by TODO grid squares.

  % final summary of omhchorp creation
  Figure \ref{Model:saving_omhchorp:fig_flow_omhchorp} shows an overview of how vertical columns (modelled and measured) along with filters and sundry data are created in this thesis.
  %TODO Brief description of summarising schematic
  Output from GEOS-Chem is combined with OMHCHO swath data to produce a gridded data file which contains new and old satellite vertical columns along with modelled vertical columns.
  The original AMF as well as those recalculated using GEOS-Chem, and associated corrected vertical columns are all binned and stored.
  Masks created using MODIS and OMI measurements are also stored in the OMHCHORP dataset.
